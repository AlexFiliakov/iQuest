# Duplicate Record Prevention Implementation

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive duplicate record prevention for Apple Health data imports to ensure data integrity and prevent double-counting of health records.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`src/database.py`)
- Added a unique constraint to the `health_records` table on columns: `(type, sourceName, startDate, endDate, value)`
- Created migration #3 to update existing databases with the new constraint
- Migration automatically removes existing duplicates when upgrading

### 2. Data Import Logic Updates

#### Standard XML Import (`src/data_loader.py`)
- Changed from `if_exists='replace'` (which deleted all data) to `INSERT OR IGNORE`
- Now preserves existing data and only adds new unique records
- Converts datetime objects to strings to avoid SQLite binding errors
- Reports number of new records imported vs duplicates skipped

#### Streaming XML Import (`src/xml_streaming_processor.py`)
- Updated to use `INSERT OR IGNORE` instead of bulk `append`
- Processes records individually to track duplicates
- Reports import statistics including duplicates skipped

### 3. Key Benefits
- **No data loss**: Existing records are preserved during imports
- **No duplicates**: Identical records are automatically rejected
- **Incremental imports**: Can safely import multiple files or re-import
- **Performance**: Unique constraint provides fast duplicate detection
- **Transparency**: Users see how many records were imported vs skipped

## Testing Results
All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Standard import prevents duplicates
- ✅ Streaming import prevents duplicates  
- ✅ Database migration removes existing duplicates
- ✅ Re-imports don't create duplicates

## Usage
Users can now:
1. Import the same file multiple times without creating duplicates
2. Import data from multiple sources without worrying about overlaps
3. See exactly how many new records were added vs duplicates skipped
4. Trust that their health metrics won't be inflated by duplicate data
