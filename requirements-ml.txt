# Optional ML dependencies for advanced features
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
# Note: These are optional dependencies for advanced ML features that are not
# currently implemented in the codebase but may be added in future versions.
# IMPORTANT: scikit-learn is now updated to >=1.6.0,<1.7.0 in requirements.txt
# for compatibility with darts 0.35.0, sktime, and imbalanced-learn.
