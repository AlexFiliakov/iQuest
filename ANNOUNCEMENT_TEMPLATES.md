Hey QS community!

I'm excited to share Apple Health Monitor 1.0, a Windows desktop app I've been working on that lets you analyze your Apple Health exports with proper visualizations and analytics.

**The Problem:** Apple Health has amazing data collection, but limited analysis tools, especially on Windows.

**The Solution:** A desktop app that imports your health export and provides:

- Daily/Weekly/Monthly dashboards with interactive charts
- Automatic anomaly detection and pattern recognition  
- Personal records tracking
- Correlation analysis between metrics
- Integrated journal for qualitative data
- Health scoring system

**Privacy:** Everything runs locally. No cloud, no accounts, no tracking. Open source so you can verify.

**Screenshots:** [Imgur album link]

**Download:** [GitHub releases link]

**Tech Stack:** Python, PyQt6, SQLite, Matplotlib

Been using it myself for 3 months and discovered some fascinating patterns in my data. For example, I found my HRV drops significantly 2 days before I get sick - now I can take preventive action!

Would love your feedback and feature suggestions. What analyses would you find most valuable?

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! I'll be around all day to answer questions.

# Introducing Apple Health Monitor: Your Health Data Deserves a Bigger Screen

*January 15, 2025*

Today, I'm thrilled to announce the release of Apple Health Monitor 1.0, a Windows desktop application that transforms your iPhone health data into actionable insights while respecting your privacy.

## The Problem

If you're like me, you've accumulated years of health data in Apple Health. Steps, heart rate, sleep, workouts - it's all there. But trying to understand long-term trends or discover patterns on a 6-inch screen feels like reading a novel through a keyhole.

Sure, Apple Health is great at collecting data, but when it comes to analysis? That's where it falls short, especially if you're a Windows user.

## The Solution

Apple Health Monitor bridges this gap. It's a desktop application that imports your Apple Health export and provides the analytical tools you need to truly understand your health data...
