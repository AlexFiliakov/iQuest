how would you approach creating a Windows executable dashboard with Python to analyze Apple Health Data? The data is processed into a Pandas table and stored as a CSV. I'd like to have the EXE take the CSV file and generate a collection of tabs that have different dashboards on them.

I'd like to have a Configuration tab where the user can select the following:
- Subset data on date range using field "creationDate".
- Subset data by combination of fields "sourceName and "type" representing the device the metric came from and the type of health metric.

Then I’d like dashboards that have different summaries of the various metrics:
- Daily metric summaries of average, min, max
- Weekly metric summaries of average, min, max
- Monthly metric summaries of average, min, max
- On daily summaries, compare to corresponding weekly and monthly statistics
- On weekly summaries, compare to corresponding monthly statistics
- If the data range is less than a month, display only daily and weekly statistics
- If the data range is less than a week, display only daily statistics

On each tab, I’d like to include a “Journal” feature to write notes on a specific day, week, month to provide some color commentary on the statistics.

Make the charts friendly and engaging, use warm welcome colors like a tan background with oranges and yellows for the main interface UI, with brown text. Make it inviting to use. Make the charts and the UI easy to follow and understand for nontechnical users who may not read charts often.

A small dataset for 2 months is available in `processed data/apple_data_subset.csv`

--------------


break down `.simone/03_SPRINTS/S03_M01_basic_analytics/S03_sprint_meta.md` into tasks for that sprint

review the task and flesh out approaches for implementation details that will help future development. Consider edge cases, testing, performance, and intuitiveness of UI and understandability of the analytics. Recommend best practices for UI building and best practices for analytics presentations. Make sure the analytics really shine and pop in this app, they are the most important feature by far. Consider any additional analytics that would be helpful and add it in as subtasks.

Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)


review `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01/SPECS_DB.md` database specification specifically for health data in light of the small data example in `processed data/apple_data_subset.csv` and recommend any changes to the database spec based on the available fields.

review the updated spec `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01/SPECS_DB.md` and make the implementation conform to the latest spec.


review the outstanding work in sprint `.simone/03_SPRINTS/S02_M01_Data_Processing/S02_sprint_meta.md` and create tasks for any remaining work. Partition the tasks for parallel work and create subtasks when the work needs to be completed together.

Make sure you adhere to all specs.


### DOCUMENTATION ###
update all docstrings in modules, submodules, classes, methods, and functions. Adhere to the Google docstring style.
update sphinx documentation templates for the latest code structure
Update README.md and CLAUDE.md with the latest directory structures



### ongoing ###############
Please analyze my codebase and create two types of mermaid diagrams:

1. **High-Level Context Diagram**: Show the overall system architecture, including:
   - Main modules/packages and their relationships
   - External dependencies and integrations
   - Data flow between major components
   - Use a C4-style context diagram or flowchart format

2. **Detailed Class Interaction Diagrams**: For each major module, create:
   - Class relationships (inheritance, composition, dependencies)
   - Key method interactions and data flow
   - Interface implementations
   - Use class diagrams or sequence diagrams as appropriate
   - Create bird's-eye view and detailed views of complex classes

For each diagram:
- Include clear titles and descriptions
- Use meaningful node labels
- Add comments explaining complex relationships
- Ensure diagrams are readable when rendered

Please save the diagrams as separate .md files with embedded mermaid code blocks.

## Recommended File Organization ##
Here's where I'd suggest saving the mermaid diagrams:

```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── README.md                 # Overview and index
│   ├── context_diagram.md        # High-level system context
│   ├── module_overview.md        # Module relationships
│   └── class_diagrams/
│       ├── core_classes.md
│       ├── data_models.md
│       └── service_layer.md
└── diagrams/                     # Alternative location
README.md                         # Link to architecture docs
```

I already created the folders `docs/architecture/`, `docs/architecture/class_diagrams`, and `docs/diagrams/`, so save there and fill out the file structure above.

## Specific Mermaid Diagram Types ##
### For Context Diagrams:
`flowchart TD` - Top-down system flow
`graph LR` - Left-right component relationships
`C4Context` - If using C4 model notation

### For Class Interactions:
`classDiagram` - Static class relationships
`sequenceDiagram` - Method call sequences
`flowchart` - Process flows within modules

## Additional Instructions ##
- Document configuration flows and dependency injection patterns
- Create a Claude command markdown file under `.claude/commands/simone` called `mermaid.md` with instructions for keeping the mermaid diagrams current as code evolves.






###### S08_M01 ##########
- Create a sprint `S08_M01_Gamification` to gamify health data as an RPG based on health statistics to encourage healthier behavior. Utilize character progress, class determination (warrior, wizard, etc), subclassing, skills, and new item/equipment findings along the way. Add interesting elements. Create a sprint for gamification with spec details of how the gamification be implemented. The game elements should fit on one separate tab, perhaps with sub-tabs for Character Sheet, Inventory, World, etc.


create a spec for gamification elements from sprint `S08_M01_Gamification` fully specifying the character system, class system, level progression, skill tree, and item system. The spec should be located in `02_REQUIREMENTS/SPEC_GAMIFICATION.md`. The spec should be detailed, but organized well enough and provide high-level overviews of all mechanics so that I can get up to speed quickly and assess its effectiveness as a game to make further tweaks and refinements to the various game elements.


Think deeply and update sprint `S08_M01_Gamification` and its tasks to conform to the gamification specs in `02_REQUIREMENTS/SPEC_GAMIFICATION.md` and `02_REQUIREMENTS/SPEC_GAMIFICATION_ADDENDUM.md`. Update tasks and create new ones as needed. Provide implementation details and summarize implementation pros and cons of various approaches when multiple possibilities are viable.

Reconcile the humorous script in `SPEC_GAMIFICATION_HUMOR.md` with specs `SPEC_GAMIFICATION.md` and `SPEC_GAMIFICATION_ADDENDUM.md` for sprint `S08_M01_Gamification`. Fill in any missing humorous elements in the same style for the remaining elements in `SPEC_GAMIFICATION.md` and `SPEC_GAMIFICATION_ADDENDUM.md`. Then, update subtasks with details in sprint `S08_M01_Gamification`, particularly task `T09_S08_humor_content.md`.


### Simplify ###
  1. Create a new branch
  2. Delete everything except:
    - Basic PyQt window
    - CSV/XML parser (simplified)
    - Simple matplotlib charts
    - Basic SQLite for settings

#### Screenshot Analysis ####
Please help me evaluate and improve my PyQt6 application's UI design:

1. Run an isolated UI element through the PyQt6 output, such as charts, graphs, windows, heatmaps, etc.

2. Once the application is running, use `mcp-screenshot` mcp server to capture the main window:
   - Take a full screenshot of the application
   - If there are multiple windows or tabs, capture each key interface

3. Analyze each screenshot for:
   - Overall aesthetic quality and modern design principles
   - Color scheme effectiveness and accessibility
   - Typography choices and readability
   - Layout and spacing issues
   - Visual hierarchy and information organization
   - User experience flow and intuitive navigation
   - Conformity to Wall Street Journal style

4. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for:
   - Color palette improvements (with hex codes if possible)
   - Font and sizing adjustments
   - Spacing and alignment fixes
   - Modern UI element suggestions (rounded corners, shadows, etc.)
   - Accessibility improvements (contrast ratios, etc.)
   - Any outdated UI patterns that could be modernized

5. If you identify significant issues, suggest specific PyQt6 code changes or styling approaches to implement the improvements.

------

Create a UI Spec in file `.simone/01_SPECS/UI_SPECS.md` detailing your approach to UI/UX. Be thorough and detailed to clarify future development. Then update other documents to refer to `.simone/01_SPECS/UI_SPECS.md` for UI/UX specifications and details. Review `.simone/01_SPECS/UI_SPECS.md` when you’re done and add more clarity and detail as needed.


Create a list of all the advanced statistical capabilities implemented in the project. Make a detailed list in file `.simone/01_SPECS/STATS.md` and how they can be used in the application. Then review your list in `.simone/01_SPECS/STATS.md` and add more clarity and detail as needed.

### Bug Templates ###

--- Template 1 ------

1. Evaluate the screenshots of `ad hoc/records_subtab.png`, which shows the Records > Records subtab, and `ad hoc/badges_subtab.png`, which shows the Records > Badges subtab. Right now the records and badges don’t display properly.

2. I think the overall structure of the layout is good, but it’s missing the content of the records and badges.

3. Identify needed repairs to display the content correctly.

4. Display the content in a visually appealing manner so that it fits within the cards allocated, be mindful of the padding and keep it small.

--- Template 2 --------

1. Evaluate the screenshots of `ad hoc/config_window.png`, which shows the data section of the Config tab. Right now the UI is too cramped vertically and does not allow for any exploration or data manipulation at all. The user can’t even see most of this UI.

2. I think the overall structure of the layout is good, but it needs to be expanded vertically a lot to make space for the content.

3. Identify needed repairs to display the content correctly vertically with a vertical scrollbar to accommodate the increased window visible height.

4. Display the content and UI in a visually appealing manner and usable, so that it fits within the cards allocated, be mindful of the padding and keep it small. Adhere to the spec `UI_SPEC.md`

---- Template 3 ----------

1. Evaluate the screenshots of `ad hoc/badges_subtab.png`, which shows a section of the Records > Badges subtab. Right now the badge subtext gets cropped above and below.

2. I think the overall structure of the layout is good, but the badge top and bottom padding needs to be made smaller so that the badge subtext can expand accordingly.

3. Identify needed repairs to display the content correctly.

4. Display the content in a visually appealing manner so that it fits within the cards allocated, be mindful of the padding and keep it small.

#### Current #####

update the spec `METRIC_SPEC.md` with the latest specifications of the methods responsible for discovering and caching available health metrics across all UI tabs in the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard. Then review the spec and fill in implementation details in a concise and understandable way. Provide important implementations. Also review the following specs similarly for any updates:
- `DAILY_TAB.md`
- `WEEKLY_TAB.md`
- `MONTHLY_TAB.md`
- `MONTHLY_SUMMARY_SPEC.md`
- `RECORDS.md`



Implement a loading screen while the app loads, which displays the message log to the user. The loading screen should follow the UI specification in `UI_SPECS.md`


Fix Records `RECORDS.md`



### Future ####


How would you approach dealing with the warning `apple_health_monitor.src.xml_streaming_processor - WARNING - xml_streaming_processor.py:188 - _process_record() - Memory usage over limit: 542.3MB` when importing large files? It clogs up the logs and isn’t very informative. Do you have a strategy for optimizing the load process, or perhaps we should increase the memory limit cap to 1BG for this notification?








-----------






#### Testing ####

create a general task `G085_FIX_BROKEN_TESTS.md`, then run each test in directory `tests/` individually using pytest, and for any warnings or errors create subtasks in `G085_FIX_BROKEN_TESTS.md`. Each subtask should have notes detailing the problem and a recommended approach to repair. Then, review the task you have created, consolidate redundant problem subtasks, and expand subtask details on the tradeoffs of various approaches. Add this task to the current sprint as an important infrastructural hotfix.
