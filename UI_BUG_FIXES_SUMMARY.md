# UI Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Monthly Tab Breaking When Navigating Away
**Problem**: The Monthly tab was attempting to import `ModernMonthlyDashboardWidget` which might not exist or have issues, causing the tab to break.

**Solution**:
- Added fallback logic to try importing `ModernMonthlyDashboardWidget` first
- If that fails, falls back to the regular `MonthlyDashboardWidget`
- Added proper error handling to prevent the entire tab from breaking

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ui/main_window.py` - Line 452-476

### 2. Daily Tab Not Refreshing Visible Area Fully
**Problem**: When navigating to the Daily tab, the UI elements weren't fully refreshing, leaving some areas not properly rendered.

**Solutions**:
1. Fixed import issue with `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` (was incorrectly imported twice)
2. Enhanced the `showEvent` method to include a delayed refresh
3. Added `_delayed_refresh` method that updates all components after a 100ms delay
4. Improved the data refresh logic in `_refresh_daily_data` to handle different data access patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ui/daily_dashboard_widget.py` - Lines 16-22, 1367-1388
- `src/ui/main_window.py` - Lines 1254-1314

### 3. Daily Tab Not Displaying Statistics
**Problem**: The summary cards on the Daily tab weren't showing any statistics due to incorrect method calls.

**Solution**:
- Changed from calling `update_value()` to `update_content()` on SummaryCard widgets
- Updated the data structure passed to match the expected format:
  - Added 'title' field for the card title
  - Added 'subtitle' field for additional context
  - Changed 'status' to use proper status values
- Added proper handling for when personal records tracker is not available

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ui/daily_dashboard_widget.py` - Lines 839-896

## Technical Details

### Import Structure Fix
The original code had duplicate imports causing shadow effect issues:
```python
# Before:
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QGraphicsDropShadowEffect  # At the end

# After:
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import (..., QGraphicsDropShadowEffect)  # In main import
```

### Refresh Logic Enhancement
Added a two-stage refresh process:
1. Immediate refresh on `showEvent`
2. Delayed refresh after 100ms to ensure all Qt events are processed

### Data Access Improvements
Updated the data access logic to handle both direct property access and method calls:
```python
if hasattr(self.config_tab, 'get_filtered_data'):
    data = self.config_tab.get_filtered_data()
elif hasattr(self.config_tab, 'filtered_data'):
    data = self.config_tab.filtered_data
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monthly Tab**: 
   - Navigate to Monthly tab and then to other tabs
   - Verify the tab loads correctly and doesn't break

2. **Daily Tab Refresh**:
   - Load data in Configuration tab
   - Navigate to Daily tab
   - Verify all UI elements are properly rendered
   - Switch between tabs and return to Daily tab

3. **Daily Statistics**:
   - Ensure data is loaded
   - Check that all four summary cards display values:
     - Activity Score
     - Goals Progress
     - Personal Bests
     - Health Status

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a centralized data manager to avoid repeated data access patterns
2. Add loading states for all dashboard widgets
3. Implement error boundaries for each tab to prevent cascading failures
4. Add unit tests for the refresh logic and data display methods
