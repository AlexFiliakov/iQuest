2. adaptive_configuration_tab.py (379 lines)
3. goal_progress_widget.py (371 lines)
4. export_dialog.py (346 lines)

1. configuration_tab.py (8.7% - 714 lines)
2. enhanced_line_chart.py (9.5% - 591 lines)
3. advanced_trend_engine.py (9.2% - 588 lines)
4. goal_management_system.py (16.6% - 553 lines)
5. table_components.py (16.1% - 503 lines)

## Strategy to Reach 90% Coverage

### Phase 1: High-Impact Modules (Est. +15% coverage)
- Create tests for all 0% coverage modules over 300 lines
- Focus on UI components that are widely used
- Estimated lines to cover: ~6,000

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Est. +20% coverage)
- Improve coverage for analytics engines
- Test all chart and visualization components
- Test data processing pipelines
- Estimated lines to cover: ~8,400

### Phase 3: Integration & Edge Cases (Est. +25% coverage)
- Create integration tests for workflows
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Test performance-critical paths
- Estimated lines to cover: ~10,500

### Phase 4: Final Push (Est. +13.8% coverage)
- Fill gaps in smaller modules
- Add property-based tests
- Increase branch coverage
- Estimated lines to cover: ~5,800

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus on large modules with 0% coverage first
2. **Use Test Generators**: Consider using test generation tools for boilerplate
3. **Leverage Fixtures**: Create reusable fixtures for common test data
4. **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers could work on different modules
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Run coverage reports after each test file

## Time Estimate

Based on the current pace:
- Average time per comprehensive test file: ~30-45 minutes
- Number of test files needed: ~150-200
- Total estimated time: 75-150 hours of focused development

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made, reaching 90% coverage for this large codebase requires substantial additional effort. The created test files provide good examples and patterns that can be followed for the remaining modules.
