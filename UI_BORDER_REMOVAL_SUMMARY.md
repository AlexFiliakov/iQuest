- **Recommendation Frames**:
  - Similar treatment as insight frames
  - Maintained left border for visual hierarchy

### 4. Goal Progress Widget (src/ui/goal_progress_widget.py)

- Removed 1px solid border
- Increased padding to 16px
- Added box shadow

### 5. Health Score Visualizations (src/ui/health_score_visualizations.py)
- **ComponentScoreCard**:

  - Added box shadow
  - Updated progress bar to remove border

- **Insight Frames**:
  - Removed full border, kept left accent border

### 6. Style Manager Updates (src/ui/style_manager.py)
- Updated `get_card_style()` to use borderless design with shadows
- Added `get_borderless_card_style()` method for flexible card styling
- Added `get_accent_card_style()` method for accent-colored cards

## Design Principles Applied
1. **No Borders**: Replaced all borders with subtle box shadows for depth
2. **Increased Padding**: More internal spacing prevents text cutoff
3. **Consistent Spacing**: Improved layout spacing for better readability
4. **Subtle Shadows**: Used box-shadow instead of borders for visual hierarchy
5. **Hover Effects**: Enhanced hover states with deeper shadows
6. **Text Protection**: Added minimum widths and word wrap settings where needed

## Visual Improvements
- Cleaner, more modern appearance
- Better text visibility without cutoff
- Consistent spacing throughout the application
- Subtle depth through shadows instead of borders
- Improved hover feedback

## Testing Recommendations
1. Check all tabs for consistent styling
2. Verify text is not cut off in any cards
3. Test hover effects work smoothly
4. Ensure adequate spacing in all components
5. Verify shadow rendering on different backgrounds
