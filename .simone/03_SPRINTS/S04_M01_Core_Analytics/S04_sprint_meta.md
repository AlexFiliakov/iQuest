# Sprint S04: Daily/Weekly/Monthly Metric Calculations

## Sprint Goal
Implement the core analytics engine that calculates statistical metrics for different time periods and enables period-over-period comparisons.

## Deliverables
- [x] Daily metrics calculation (avg, min, max, std dev) - GX019
- [x] Weekly metrics aggregation with daily breakdowns - GX020
- [x] Monthly metrics aggregation with weekly summaries - GX021
- [x] Period comparison logic (day vs week, week vs month) - GX027, GX028
- [x] Trend detection and direction indicators - GX023
- [x] Caching system for computed metrics - GX022
- [x] Adaptive display based on date range - GX032

## Definition of Done
- [x] All metric calculations are accurate and fast (<500ms) - Verified through GX077
- [x] Comparisons show percentage changes correctly - GX027, GX028
- [x] Trend indicators (up/down/stable) work properly - GX023
- [x] Cache improves repeated query performance - GX022
- [x] Adaptive display shows appropriate timeframes - GX032
- [x] Unit tests verify calculation accuracy - GX048, GX079, GX080
- [x] Edge cases handled (missing data, single values) - Comprehensive test coverage

## Technical Notes
- Use pandas for efficient aggregations
- Implement caching strategy from ADR-002
- Store computed metrics in SQLite with TTL
- Handle timezone considerations
- Account for gaps in data
- Use numpy for statistical calculations

## Risks
- Risk 1: Complex date math - Mitigation: Use python-dateutil extensively
- Risk 2: Performance with large datasets - Mitigation: Smart caching strategy
