# Sprint S04: Daily/Weekly/Monthly Metric Calculations

## Sprint Goal
Implement the core analytics engine that calculates statistical metrics for different time periods and enables period-over-period comparisons.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Daily metrics calculation (avg, min, max, std dev)
- [ ] Weekly metrics aggregation with daily breakdowns
- [ ] Monthly metrics aggregation with weekly summaries
- [ ] Period comparison logic (day vs week, week vs month)
- [ ] Trend detection and direction indicators
- [ ] Caching system for computed metrics
- [ ] Adaptive display based on date range

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All metric calculations are accurate and fast (<500ms)
- [ ] Comparisons show percentage changes correctly
- [ ] Trend indicators (up/down/stable) work properly
- [ ] Cache improves repeated query performance
- [ ] Adaptive display shows appropriate timeframes
- [ ] Unit tests verify calculation accuracy
- [ ] Edge cases handled (missing data, single values)

## Technical Notes
- Use pandas for efficient aggregations
- Implement caching strategy from ADR-002
- Store computed metrics in SQLite with TTL
- Handle timezone considerations
- Account for gaps in data
- Use numpy for statistical calculations

## Risks
- Risk 1: Complex date math - Mitigation: Use python-dateutil extensively
- Risk 2: Performance with large datasets - Mitigation: Smart caching strategy
