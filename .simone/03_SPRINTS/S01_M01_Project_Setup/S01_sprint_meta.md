# Sprint S01: Project Infrastructure & Base Configuration

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, and core architectural components for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Python project structure with proper packaging
- [ ] Development environment setup (virtual env, dependencies)
- [ ] Basic PyQt6 application skeleton with window management
- [ ] SQLite database initialization and schema
- [ ] Logging and error handling framework
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Project documentation structure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Project runs with `python main.py` showing basic window
- [ ] All dependencies documented in requirements.txt
- [ ] Database creates tables on first run
- [ ] Logging outputs to console and file
- [ ] pytest runs successfully (even if no tests yet)
- [ ] README with setup instructions created
- [ ] Code follows agreed style guidelines

## Technical Notes
- Use PyQt6 for UI framework (per ADR-001)
- Implement modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Set up proper Python package structure for future distribution
- Configure logging early for debugging support

## Risks
- Risk 1: PyQt6 learning curve - Mitigation: Create simple prototypes first
- Risk 2: Conflicting dependencies - Mitigation: Use virtual environment and pin versions
