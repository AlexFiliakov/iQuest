# Sprint S01: Project Infrastructure & Base Configuration

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, and core architectural components for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard.

## Deliverables
- [x] Python project structure with proper packaging
- [x] Development environment setup (virtual env, dependencies)
- [x] Basic PyQt6 application skeleton with window management
- [x] SQLite database initialization and schema (via data_loader.py)
- [ ] Logging and error handling framework (partially done in data_loader.py)
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline setup
- [x] Project documentation structure

## Definition of Done
- [x] Project runs with `python main.py` showing basic window
- [x] All dependencies documented in requirements.txt
- [x] Database creates tables on first run (via data_loader functions)
- [ ] Logging outputs to console and file (console done, file pending)
- [x] pytest runs successfully (13 tests passing for data_loader)
- [x] README with setup instructions created
- [x] Code follows agreed style guidelines

## Technical Notes
- Use PyQt6 for UI framework (per ADR-001)
- Implement modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Set up proper Python package structure for future distribution
- Configure logging early for debugging support

## Risks
- Risk 1: PyQt6 learning curve - Mitigation: Create simple prototypes first ✓ (Basic window created)
- Risk 2: Conflicting dependencies - Mitigation: Use virtual environment and pin versions ✓ (venv setup complete)

## Progress Notes
- 2025-05-27: Completed GX001 - Python project structure with PyQt6 skeleton app
- 2025-05-27: Completed GX002 - SQLite data loader with comprehensive functionality
- Outstanding: Full logging framework with file output, CI/CD pipeline setup
