# Sprint: Health Data Gamification & RPG Elements (S10)

## Sprint Goal
Implement an engaging RPG-style gamification system that transforms health metrics into character stats, classes, skills, and progression mechanics to encourage healthier behavior through fun, humorous gameplay elements.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Tab Name**: The game is isolated in a separate tab called "iQuest", which is the name of the game
- **Character System**: Create character with stats derived from health metrics (HP, Stamina, Strength, etc.)
- **Class System**: Implement class determination based on dominant health activities (Warrior, Wizard, Ranger, etc.)
- **Progression Mechanics**: Level up system, experience points from healthy activities
- **Skill Trees**: Unlock abilities and perks based on consistent healthy behaviors
- **Item/Equipment System**: Virtual items earned through achievements and milestones
- **UI Integration**: New Gamification tab with sub-tabs for Character Sheet, Inventory, World/Quests
- **UI Specification**: components follow design system from `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/UI_SPECS.md`
- **Humor Elements**: Funny descriptions, puns, and easter eggs throughout

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] The game is isolated in a separate tab called "iQuest", which is the name of the game
- [ ] Character creation and stat calculation from health data functional
- [ ] Class assignment algorithm working with at least 5 base classes
- [ ] Level/XP system tracking progress over time
- [ ] Skill tree with at least 3 skills per class implemented
- [ ] Item/equipment system with 20+ unique items
- [ ] Gamification tab fully integrated with sub-navigation
- [ ] Component follows design system from `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/UI_SPECS.md`
- [ ] Achievement system recognizing health milestones
- [ ] Save/load system for game progress
- [ ] Humorous flavor text throughout the experience
- [ ] Performance impact minimal (<5% increase in load time)
- [ ] Unit tests for all gamification calculations
- [ ] User documentation for gamification features

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This feature extends beyond the original M01 milestone scope but adds significant user engagement value
- Consider balancing realism with fun - health data should encourage good habits, not gaming the system
- Ensure accessibility - gamification should enhance, not overshadow health insights
- Plan for future expansions: multiplayer elements, seasonal events, community challenges
- **2025-05-28**: Reconciled humor content from three gamification specs (SPEC_GAMIFICATION_HUMOR.md, SPEC_GAMIFICATION.md, and SPEC_GAMIFICATION_ADDENDUM.md) into comprehensive T09_S08_humor_content.md task with detailed subtasks covering all humor elements
