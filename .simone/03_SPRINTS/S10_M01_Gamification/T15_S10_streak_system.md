# Task: Implement Streak System & Anti-Gaming Measures

## Description
Create the comprehensive streak tracking system with protection mechanics and anti-gaming measures from the gamification spec. This includes daily streak bonuses, "Phoenix Mode" recovery, streak insurance banking, and sophisticated protection against gaming the system while encouraging genuine healthy behavior.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement daily streak system with multiplier bonuses (2x at 7 days, 3x at 30, 5x at 100)
- Build streak protection mechanics including rest days and insurance banking
- Create "Phoenix Mode" for faster streak rebuilding after breaks
- Add comprehensive anti-gaming measures to prevent system exploitation
- Include overtraining protection and mandatory rest quest triggers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Daily streak tracking with progressive XP multipliers:
  - 7-day streak: 2x XP bonus
  - 30-day streak: 3x XP bonus ("You absolute madlad")
  - 100-day streak: 5x XP bonus (legendary territory)
- [ ] Streak protection system:
  - One "rest day" allowed per week ("Even Thor takes days off")
  - Streak insurance: bank up to 3 rest days by overachieving
  - Protected streaks don't break on designated rest days
- [ ] "Phoenix Mode": Lost streaks rebuild 50% faster from failure ashes
- [ ] Anti-gaming protection measures:
  - Daily XP caps per source (prevents 1000 bicep curl exploitation)
  - Variety bonuses require 3+ different activities per week
  - Overtraining detection triggers mandatory rest quests
  - Reality checks remind that virtual gains need real exercise
- [ ] Balance enforcement: Can't level STR past 50 without proportional other stats
- [ ] Injury prevention protocol: Excessive activity triggers warning system
- [ ] Streak visualization with fire/phoenix imagery and milestone celebrations

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create streak tracking data model with protection flags and insurance counter
- [ ] Implement daily activity validation for streak continuation
- [ ] Build progressive streak bonus calculation engine (2x/3x/5x multipliers)
- [ ] Add streak protection system:
  - Rest day designation (1 per week maximum)
  - Overachievement insurance banking (up to 3 days)
  - Streak protection status indicators
- [ ] Create "Phoenix Mode" faster rebuilding after streak loss
- [ ] Implement comprehensive anti-gaming measures:
  - Daily XP source caps with intelligent detection
  - Variety requirement tracking (3+ activity types weekly)
  - Excessive activity pattern detection
  - Overtraining protection with mandatory rest triggers
- [ ] Build balance enforcement system preventing stat abuse
- [ ] Add reality check notifications and system limitations
- [ ] Create streak visualization with milestone animations
- [ ] Implement streak insurance redemption mechanics
- [ ] Add streak loss comfort messages and recovery encouragement
- [ ] Build streak analytics for long-term pattern analysis

## Streak System Mechanics

### Streak Progression Tiers
- **Beginner Tier (1-6 days)**: Base XP, learning the rhythm
- **Committed Tier (7-29 days)**: 2x XP multiplier, establishing habits
- **Dedicated Tier (30-99 days)**: 3x XP multiplier, lifestyle integration
- **Legendary Tier (100+ days)**: 5x XP multiplier, transcendent status

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Rest Day Protection**: Explicitly declare 1 rest day per week, maintains streak
- **Insurance Banking**: Overachieve goals to bank protection days (max 3)
- **Grace Period**: 6-hour window past midnight for late activity logging
- **Streak Revival**: One "mulligan" per month for technical issues or emergencies

### Phoenix Mode Recovery
- **Activation**: Triggers automatically when streak >7 days is lost
- **Accelerated Progress**: Next streak builds 50% faster to previous maximum
- **Motivation Boost**: Extra encouragement messages and milestone recognition
- **Achievement Unlock**: "Phoenix Rising" badge for streak recovery

## Anti-Gaming Protection Systems

### Daily XP Caps by Source
- **Step Counting**: Max 400 XP/day (prevents treadmill gaming)
- **Workout Minutes**: Max 360 XP/day (discourages marathon sessions)
- **Heart Rate Training**: Max 180 XP/day (prevents artificial elevation)
- **Sleep Quality**: Max 75 XP/day (can't over-sleep for points)
- **Overall Daily Cap**: 2000 XP maximum to prevent grinding

### Variety Requirements
- **Weekly Diversity**: Bonus XP requires 3+ different activity types
- **Activity Type Detection**: Automatic categorization prevents false variety
- **Cross-Training Incentives**: Mixed workouts receive enhanced bonuses
- **Monotony Penalties**: Repeated identical activities show diminishing returns

### Overtraining Protection
- **Volume Monitoring**: Track weekly activity increases and flag excessive jumps
- **Recovery Tracking**: Monitor rest periods and warn about insufficient recovery
- **Mandatory Rest Triggers**: Force rest day quests when overtraining detected
- **Injury Prevention**: Educational content about sustainable progression

### Balance Enforcement
- **Stat Caps**: Primary stats can't exceed others by >50 points without balance
- **Progression Gates**: Higher levels require more balanced development
- **Specialization Limits**: Class bonuses can't create extreme stat imbalances
- **Warning System**: Alerts when approaching dangerous imbalance territory

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Rolling Window Analysis (Recommended)
**Pros:** Accurate pattern detection, smooth progress tracking, fair evaluation
**Cons:** More complex calculations, requires historical data retention
**Implementation:** 7/30/100-day rolling windows with streak state machine

### Approach 2: Simple Daily Flag System
**Pros:** Straightforward implementation, minimal storage, easy to understand
**Cons:** Less sophisticated protection, easier to game, limited analytics
**Implementation:** Boolean daily flags with basic protection counters

### Approach 3: Machine Learning Anti-Gaming
**Pros:** Adaptive detection, learns user patterns, sophisticated protection
**Cons:** Overkill complexity, black box decisions, requires training data
**Implementation:** Anomaly detection models for unusual activity patterns
