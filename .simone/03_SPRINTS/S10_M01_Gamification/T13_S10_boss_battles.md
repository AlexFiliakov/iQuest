# Task: Implement Boss Battles & Random Encounters

## Description
Create the boss battle and random encounter system from the gamification spec addendum, featuring daily mini-bosses (The Snooze Button, The Elevator), legendary world bosses (Couch Potato King, DOMS), and environmental hazards that create engaging obstacles and choices throughout the user's health journey.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement daily mini-boss encounters that trigger based on user behavior
- Create legendary world boss battles that require sustained effort to defeat
- Add random encounters during workouts and daily activities
- Build environmental hazard system with dexterity checks and consequences
- Include humorous failure states and respawn mechanics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Daily mini-bosses implemented:
  - "The Snooze Button" (5 HP, morning encounter, defeated by no snoozing)
  - "The Elevator" (temptation check vs. stairs, 10-defeat chain unlocks "Stairmaster")
  - "The Vending Machine" (workplace raid boss, hunger-triggered, healthy choice victory)
- [ ] Legendary world bosses with multi-day encounters:
  - "Couch Potato King" with Throw Pillow Minions and Netflix Binge Ray
  - "DOMS - Delayed Onset Muscle Sorcerer" 24-48h post-workout appearance
- [ ] Character "death" mechanics: temporary failure states with humorous messages
- [ ] Environmental hazards in gym/home settings with consequence system
- [ ] Boss reward system: special items, titles, and achievement unlocks
- [ ] Boss health tracking and damage calculation based on healthy actions
- [ ] Visual boss encounter UI with health bars and attack animations

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create boss data model with HP, attacks, weaknesses, and rewards
- [ ] Implement daily mini-boss encounter triggers:
  - Snooze Button: appears on alarm, defeated by getting up on first alarm
  - Elevator: appears in buildings, willpower vs. convenience check
  - Vending Machine: workplace hunger trigger, healthy choice resolution
- [ ] Build legendary world boss system:
  - Couch Potato King: summons minions, Netflix attack, standing desk weakness
  - DOMS Sorcerer: post-workout timer, staircase nightmare debuff, stretching defeat
- [ ] Create boss combat mechanics with health bars and damage calculation
- [ ] Add environmental hazard system:
  - Gym hazards: wet floors (dex check), broken equipment (adaptation), mirror walls
  - Home hazards: midnight fridge (willpower save), comfy bed (escape velocity)
- [ ] Implement character "death" and respawn system with humor:
  - "You have temporarily ceased to function. Try turning yourself off and on again."
  - "Critical motivation failure. Deploying emergency cat videos."
- [ ] Create boss reward distribution (special items, titles, achievements)
- [ ] Build boss encounter UI with fantasy RPG styling
- [ ] Add boss battle notifications and victory celebrations
- [ ] Implement boss encounter history and statistics tracking

## Boss Battle Mechanics

### Daily Mini-Boss Encounters
- **Encounter Triggers**: Time-based, behavior-based, location-based
- **Combat Resolution**: Single action success/failure with immediate result
- **Reward Structure**: Small XP bonuses, streak protection, minor items

### Legendary World Boss System  
- **Multi-Day Encounters**: Bosses have high HP requiring sustained healthy behavior
- **Progressive Damage**: Each healthy action deals damage proportional to effort
- **Special Attacks**: Bosses can inflict temporary debuffs (Netflix Binge Ray immobilizes 6h)
- **Community Aspects**: Some bosses require collective effort (1M steps to defeat Couch King)

### Environmental Hazard Engine
- **Check System**: Dexterity, Willpower, Wisdom checks with difficulty ratings
- **Consequence Scaling**: Minor embarrassment to temporary stat penalties
- **Recovery Mechanics**: Actions to restore status or wait for natural recovery

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: State Machine Boss System (Recommended)
**Pros:** Clear state transitions, easy to debug, predictable behavior
**Cons:** May feel scripted, limited dynamic behavior
**Implementation:** Boss states (dormant, encountered, active, defeated) with transition triggers

### Approach 2: Event-Driven Encounter System
**Pros:** More dynamic, responsive to user behavior, emergent gameplay
**Cons:** Complex to balance, potential for unexpected interactions
**Implementation:** Health data events trigger encounter checks with probability calculations

### Approach 3: Scheduled Boss Rotation
**Pros:** Predictable content, easy to balance, consistent user experience
**Cons:** Less dynamic, may feel repetitive over time
**Implementation:** Calendar-based boss appearances with rotation schedule
