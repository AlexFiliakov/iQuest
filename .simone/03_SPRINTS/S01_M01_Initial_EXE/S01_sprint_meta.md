# Sprint: Data Processing Pipeline (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the foundational data import and processing pipeline for Apple Health data, including CSV/XML import capabilities, SQLite storage layer, and core infrastructure components.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- [x] CSV import with large file support
- [x] XML to SQLite conversion for Apple Health exports
- [x] Data model and schema definition
- [x] Filtering and aggregation engine (query methods)
- [x] SQLite storage layer with indexes
- [x] Python project structure setup
- [x] Logging and error handling framework
- [x] Unit tests for data processing components


## Sprint Backlog

### Completed Tasks
- [x] GX001: Setup Python project structure with PyQt6 foundation
- [x] GX002: Implement SQLite data loader with XML/CSV import
- [x] GX005: Implement logging and error handling framework

### Data Processing Components
- [x] XML parser for Apple Health export format
- [x] CSV to SQLite migration utility
- [x] Date field parsing and indexing
- [x] Numeric value handling with NaN support
- [x] Query methods for date ranges and metrics
- [x] Daily summary aggregation queries


## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
This sprint will be considered complete when:

- [x] Data can be imported from both CSV and XML formats
- [x] SQLite database is properly indexed for performance
- [x] Query methods support date range and metric type filtering
- [x] Logging framework captures all operations
- [x] Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- [x] Unit tests cover core data processing functionality

## Notes / Context
how would you approach creating a Windows executable dashboard with Python to analyze Apple Health Data? The data is processed into a Pandas table and stored as a CSV. I'd like to have the EXE take the CSV file and generate a collection of tabs that have different dashboards on them.

I'd like to have a Configuration tab where the user can select the following:
- Subset data on date range using field "creationDate".
- Subset data by combination of fields "sourceName and "type" representing the device the metric came from and the type of health metric.

Then I’d like dashboards that have different summaries of the various metrics:
- Daily metric summaries of average, min, max
- Weekly metric summaries of average, min, max
- Monthly metric summaries of average, min, max
- On daily summaries, compare to corresponding weekly and monthly statistics
- On weekly summaries, compare to corresponding monthly statistics
- If the data range is less than a month, display only daily and weekly statistics
- If the data range is less than a week, display only daily statistics

On each tab, I’d like to include a “Journal” feature to write notes on a specific day, week, month to provide some color commentary on the statistics.

Make the charts friendly and engaging, use warm welcome colors like a tan background with oranges and yellows for the main interface UI, with brown text. Make it inviting to use. Make the charts and the UI easy to follow and understand for nontechnical users who may not read charts often.

A small dataset for 2 months is available in `processed data/apple_data_subset.csv`

## Sprint Summary

### Completed Components
1. **Data Import Infrastructure**
   - XML to SQLite converter with full Apple Health export support
   - CSV to SQLite migration utility for existing data
   - Optimized indexes for date range and metric type queries
   - Support for 97,280+ records with fast query performance

2. **Project Foundation**
   - Python project structure with src/, tests/, assets/ directories
   - PyQt6 main application skeleton
   - Requirements.txt with all dependencies
   - Test infrastructure with pytest

3. **Logging & Error Handling**
   - Centralized logging configuration with file rotation
   - Console and file outputs with different log levels
   - Custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
   - Exception hook for uncaught errors with user dialogs
   - Comprehensive error decorators and context managers

4. **Data Processing Features**
   - Date field parsing with timezone support
   - Numeric value handling with NaN replacement
   - Type name cleaning (removes HKQuantityTypeIdentifier prefixes)
   - Query methods for date ranges and specific metrics
   - Daily summary aggregation queries

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for data loader (11 tests)
- Unit tests for logging framework (3 tests)
- Unit tests for error handling (8 tests)
- All tests passing with proper imports

### Outstanding Items (Moved to Future Sprints)
- [ ] Windows executable compilation (moved to S02/S03)
- [ ] UI implementation with graphs and tabs (S02)
- [ ] Journal/notes persistence (S03)
- [ ] Integration tests (S03)
- [ ] 95%+ code coverage target (ongoing)
