# Sprint S03: Dashboard UI Framework with Tab Navigation

## Sprint Goal
Create the main application UI structure with tab navigation, warm visual theme, and responsive layout following the UI/UX specifications.

## Deliverables
- [x] Main window with proper sizing and positioning
- [x] Tab navigation (Config, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Journal)
- [x] Warm color theme implementation (tan, orange, yellow)
- [x] Configuration tab UI with file picker and filters
- [x] Date range picker component
- [x] Multi-select dropdowns for sources and types
- [x] Status bar with data statistics
- [x] Loading states and progress indicators

## Definition of Done
- [x] All tabs are navigable with proper layouts
- [x] Warm color scheme matches design specifications
- [ ] UI is responsive and scales properly
- [x] Tab switching is smooth (<100ms)
- [x] All interactive elements have hover states
- [x] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- [ ] Empty states show appropriate messages
- [x] UI components are reusable and well-organized

## Technical Notes
- Use Qt Style Sheets (QSS) for theming
- Implement custom widgets for consistent look
- Create reusable component library
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Use layouts for responsive design
- Cache UI elements for performance

## Risks
- Risk 1: Complex theming requirements - Mitigation: Create style guide early
- Risk 2: Performance with many widgets - Mitigation: Lazy loading, virtualization
