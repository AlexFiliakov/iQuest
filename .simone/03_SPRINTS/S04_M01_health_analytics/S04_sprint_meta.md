# Sprint S04: Comprehensive Health Analytics

## Sprint Goal
Implement comprehensive health analytics features based on popular Apple Health metrics and user needs, providing actionable insights through interactive visualizations and correlation analysis.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Core Health Metrics Dashboard
- **Activity Analytics**: Steps, distance, floors climbed, active calories visualization
- **Heart Health Monitor**: Resting heart rate trends, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis
- **Sleep Pattern Analysis**: Sleep duration trends, quality scoring, consistency metrics
- **Body Metrics Tracking**: Weight trends, BMI calculations, body composition changes

### 2. Advanced Trend Analysis
- **Multi-period Comparisons**: Week-over-week, month-over-month, year-over-year
- **Personal Records Tracking**: Identify and highlight personal bests
- **Goal Progress Visualization**: Visual progress bars and achievement tracking
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual patterns in health metrics

### 3. Health Correlations Engine
- **Sleep-Activity Correlation**: Analyze how exercise affects sleep quality
- **HRV-Stress Analysis**: Track stress patterns through heart rate variability
- **Recovery Insights**: Rest day optimization based on activity strain
- **Custom Correlation Discovery**: User-defined metric relationships

### 4. Interactive Visualizations
- **Activity Rings**: Apple Watch-style circular progress indicators
- **Heat Maps**: Activity patterns, sleep consistency, heart zone distribution
- **Comparative Charts**: Side-by-side metric comparisons with annotations
- **Time Series Zoom**: Interactive date range selection and filtering

### 5. Health Insights & Recommendations
- **Daily Readiness Score**: Composite score from sleep, HRV, and activity
- **Baseline Establishment**: Calculate personal normal ranges
- **Deviation Alerts**: Highlight when metrics fall outside personal baselines
- **Actionable Insights**: Context-aware recommendations based on patterns

### 6. Export & Reporting
- **PDF Health Reports**: Comprehensive summaries for healthcare providers
- **CSV Data Export**: Filtered data export for further analysis
- **Chart Image Export**: Save visualizations as images
- **Shareable Dashboards**: Generate shareable links for specific views

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All core health metrics are visualized with appropriate chart types
- [ ] Trend analysis works across all supported time periods
- [ ] At least 5 correlation analyses are implemented and tested
- [ ] Interactive features respond within 500ms
- [ ] Health insights are generated based on actual data patterns
- [ ] Export functionality produces professional-quality outputs
- [ ] All features follow the warm color scheme (tan/orange/yellow)
- [ ] Charts include helpful tooltips and legends
- [ ] Unit tests cover core analytics calculations
- [ ] Performance tested with 1+ year of health data

## Technical Approach
- **Analytics Engine**: NumPy/Pandas for statistical calculations
- **Visualization**: PyQtGraph for interactive charts, Matplotlib for static exports
- **Caching**: LRU cache for expensive calculations
- **Background Processing**: Threading for large dataset analysis
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and bounds checking

## Dependencies
- Sprint S01: Data processing pipeline must be complete
- Sprint S02: Core UI framework must support multiple chart types
- Sprint S03: Basic analytics provide foundation for advanced features

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complex calculations slow down UI
  - **Mitigation**: Implement progressive loading and caching
- **Risk**: Too many features overwhelm users
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize most-requested analytics, hide advanced features
- **Risk**: Correlation analysis produces misleading results
  - **Mitigation**: Include statistical significance indicators and disclaimers
