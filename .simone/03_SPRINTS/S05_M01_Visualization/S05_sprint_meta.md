# Sprint S05: Chart Implementation with Warm UI Theme

## Sprint Goal
Create beautiful, intuitive data visualizations that follow the warm color scheme and make health data easy to understand for non-technical users.

## Deliverables
- [x] Time series line charts for daily metrics
- [x] Bar charts for weekly comparisons
- [x] Calendar heatmap for monthly view
- [x] Chart hover interactions with tooltips
- [x] Smooth animations and transitions
- [x] Chart export functionality (PNG/PDF)
- [x] Responsive chart sizing
- [x] Legend and axis formatting

## Definition of Done
- [x] All chart types render correctly with data
- [x] Charts use warm color palette consistently
- [x] Hover shows detailed information
- [x] Charts animate smoothly on data changes
- [x] Export produces high-quality images
- [x] Charts are readable at different sizes
- [x] Performance remains smooth with large datasets
- [x] Accessibility features implemented (alt text)

## Sprint Completion Notes
While all deliverables were technically implemented, the sprint suffered from significant over-engineering:
- Implemented dual rendering engines (matplotlib + pyqtgraph) instead of single solution
- Added ML-based visualization optimizations not required by sprint goals
- Created overly complex performance optimization system for simple charts
- WSJ-style implementation became overly elaborate with unnecessary features

**Recommendation:** Future sprints should focus on simplicity and meeting exact requirements without gold-plating.

## Technical Notes
- Use matplotlib with Qt backend
- Implement custom color schemes
- Create reusable chart components
- Use pyqtgraph for real-time updates if needed
- Optimize rendering for large datasets
- Cache rendered charts when possible
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)

## Risks
- Risk 1: Chart performance with many data points - Mitigation: Data sampling, virtualization
- Risk 2: Complex interactivity requirements - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement
