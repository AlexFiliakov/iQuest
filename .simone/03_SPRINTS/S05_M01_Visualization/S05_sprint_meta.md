# Sprint S05: Chart Implementation with Warm UI Theme

## Sprint Goal
Create beautiful, intuitive data visualizations that follow the warm color scheme and make health data easy to understand for non-technical users.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Time series line charts for daily metrics
- [ ] Bar charts for weekly comparisons
- [ ] Calendar heatmap for monthly view
- [ ] Chart hover interactions with tooltips
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Chart export functionality (PNG/PDF)
- [ ] Responsive chart sizing
- [ ] Legend and axis formatting

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All chart types render correctly with data
- [ ] Charts use warm color palette consistently
- [ ] Hover shows detailed information
- [ ] Charts animate smoothly on data changes
- [ ] Export produces high-quality images
- [ ] Charts are readable at different sizes
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with large datasets
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented (alt text)

## Technical Notes
- Use matplotlib with Qt backend
- Implement custom color schemes
- Create reusable chart components
- Use pyqtgraph for real-time updates if needed
- Optimize rendering for large datasets
- Cache rendered charts when possible
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)

## Risks
- Risk 1: Chart performance with many data points - Mitigation: Data sampling, virtualization
- Risk 2: Complex interactivity requirements - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement
