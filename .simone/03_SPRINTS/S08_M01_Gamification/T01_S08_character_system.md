# Task: Implement Character System with Health-Based Stats

## Description
Create the core character system that transforms health metrics into RPG-style character statistics with humor and personality. This system will analyze various health data points and convert them into the 8 core stats defined in the gamification spec, complete with witty descriptions and meaningful progression.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement the exact 8-stat system from SPEC_GAMIFICATION.md
- Create stat calculation algorithms using the specified formulas
- Add temporary buffs/debuffs and status effects
- Implement character progression with level-based stat increases
- Include humor elements throughout the character system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Exact 8 core stats implemented: HP, Stamina, Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Vitality, Wisdom, Charisma
- [ ] Stat calculations use spec formula: `Base Stat = (Metric Value / Metric Target) * Level Modifier * Class Bonus`
- [ ] Humorous stat descriptions display ("Ability to climb stairs without sounding like Darth Vader")
- [ ] Stats update using 7-day rolling averages for consistency
- [ ] Temporary bonuses: "Well-Rested" (+5% all stats), "Coffee Buff" (+15% morning workouts)
- [ ] Character level affects stat scaling with Level Modifier = Level * 1.1
- [ ] Status effects system: buffs (Runner's High, Beast Mode) and debuffs (Leg Day Aftermath, Carb Coma)
- [ ] Performance: stat calculation < 100ms per the technical requirements
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >95% coverage with humorous test names

- Database Schema: `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01/SPECS_DB.md`
- Data Model: `src/models.py`
- Analytics Engine: `src/data_access.py`
- UI Architecture: `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define character data model with exact spec stats and humorous descriptions
- [ ] Implement health metric mappings:
  - HP: Overall health score (100-9999 range)
  - Stamina: Daily steps + active minutes
  - Strength: Workout intensity + calories burned  
  - Intelligence: Mindfulness minutes + sleep quality
  - Dexterity: Movement variety + workout consistency
  - Vitality: Resting heart rate + HRV
  - Wisdom: Long-term consistency + streak days
  - Charisma: Social workouts + achievements shared
- [ ] Create stat calculation engine using spec formula with proper scaling
- [ ] Implement temporary buff system (Well-Rested, Coffee Buff, Pizza Penalty)
- [ ] Add status effects with duration tracking and visual indicators
- [ ] Create character progression system with permanent stat boosts every 5 levels
- [ ] Integrate rolling average calculations for stat stability
- [ ] Build anti-gaming protection (daily XP caps, variety bonuses)
- [ ] Write unit tests with humorous names ("test_coffee_buff_makes_morning_workouts_less_painful")
- [ ] Add stat tooltip system showing calculation breakdown and humor text

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Real-time Calculation (Recommended)
**Pros:** Always current, no storage overhead, simple architecture
**Cons:** Slight performance cost, requires health data availability
**Implementation:** Calculate stats on-demand using cached 7-day averages

### Approach 2: Cached Pre-calculation  
**Pros:** Fastest access, predictable performance
**Cons:** Storage overhead, synchronization complexity, potential staleness
**Implementation:** Background task updates cached stats hourly

### Approach 3: Hybrid System
**Pros:** Best of both worlds, graceful degradation
**Cons:** Most complex implementation  
**Implementation:** Cache with real-time fallback for missing data

**Recommendation:** Use Approach 1 for MVP, migrate to Approach 3 if performance issues arise.
