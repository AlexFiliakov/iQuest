# Task: Implement Character System with Health-Based Stats

## Description
Create the core character system that transforms health metrics into RPG-style character statistics. This system will analyze various health data points and convert them into game attributes like HP, Stamina, Strength, Intelligence, Agility, etc.

## Goal / Objectives
- Design a character data model with RPG stats
- Create algorithms to calculate stats from health metrics
- Implement stat modifiers and bonuses
- Provide real-time stat updates based on new health data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Character model defined with at least 8 core stats
- [ ] Health metric to stat conversion algorithms implemented
- [ ] Stats update dynamically when health data changes
- [ ] Character level calculation based on overall health score
- [ ] Base stats and modified stats properly separated
- [ ] Unit tests cover all stat calculations with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance: stat calculation < 100ms for typical dataset

## Important References
- Database Schema: `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01/SPECS_DB.md`
- Data Model: `src/models.py`
- Analytics Engine: `src/data_access.py`
- UI Architecture: `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design character data model with core stats (HP, MP, Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Vitality, Wisdom, Charisma)
- [ ] Map health metrics to character stats (steps → Dexterity, heart rate → Vitality, etc.)
- [ ] Implement stat calculation algorithms with scaling factors
- [ ] Create character level formula based on cumulative health score
- [ ] Add stat modifier system for temporary bonuses/penalties
- [ ] Integrate with existing data access layer
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Document stat formulas for player understanding
