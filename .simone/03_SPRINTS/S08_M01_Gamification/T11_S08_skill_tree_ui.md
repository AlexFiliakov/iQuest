# Task: Create Interactive Skill Tree UI Component

## Description
Build the visual skill tree component separate from the skill system logic. This component should provide an interactive, visually appealing interface for skill selection and progression visualization.

## Goal / Objectives
- Design visual skill tree layout algorithm
- Implement interactive node components
- Create connection lines and animations
- Add zoom and pan functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill nodes displayed in tree structure
- [ ] Visual connections between prerequisites
- [ ] Hover effects show skill details
- [ ] Click to allocate/deallocate points
- [ ] Zoom in/out functionality
- [ ] Pan/drag to navigate large trees
- [ ] Different visual states (locked/available/learned)
- [ ] Smooth animations for interactions
