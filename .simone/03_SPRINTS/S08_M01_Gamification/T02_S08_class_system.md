# Task: Implement Class System with Activity-Based Assignment

## Description
Develop a class system that analyzes a user's dominant health activities and assigns appropriate RPG classes. Classes should reflect the user's lifestyle patterns and provide unique bonuses and progression paths.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create base classes reflecting different activity patterns
- Implement class assignment algorithm based on health data
- Design subclass progression system
- Add class-specific bonuses and abilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 5 base classes implemented (Warrior, Wizard, Ranger, Cleric, Rogue)
- [ ] Class assignment algorithm analyzes 30+ days of data
- [ ] Subclass unlocking at level 10+ with specializations
- [ ] Class-specific stat bonuses properly applied
- [ ] Multi-classing support for balanced activity patterns
- [ ] Class descriptions are humorous and engaging
- [ ] Visual class badges/icons in UI

  - Warrior (high physical activity)
  - Wizard (meditation/mindfulness focus)
  - Ranger (outdoor activities/hiking)
  - Cleric (consistent sleep patterns)
  - Rogue (varied workout times)
- [ ] Create activity pattern recognition algorithms
- [ ] Implement class assignment logic with thresholds
- [ ] Design subclass trees (e.g., Warrior â†’ Berserker/Paladin)
