# Task: Comprehensive Gamification Testing

## Description
Create comprehensive test suites for all gamification features including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks. Ensure the gamification system doesn't negatively impact core health monitoring functionality.

## Goal / Objectives
- Achieve >85% test coverage for gamification code
- Verify integration with existing features
- Benchmark performance impact
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all game calculations
- [ ] Integration tests for UI components
- [ ] Performance tests show <5% impact
- [ ] Save/load functionality fully tested
- [ ] Achievement unlock logic verified
- [ ] Item system edge cases handled
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] No regression in core features

## Important References
- Test Framework: `tests/`
- Unit Tests: `tests/unit/`
- Integration Tests: `tests/integration/`
- Performance Requirements: `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M01/PRD.md`

## Subtasks
