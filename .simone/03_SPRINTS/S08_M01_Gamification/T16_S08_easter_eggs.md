## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Pattern Recognition Engine (Recommended)
**Pros:** Flexible detection, extensible for new secrets, accurate matching
**Cons:** More complex logic, requires pattern definition language
**Implementation:** Configurable pattern matchers with state machines

### Approach 2: Hard-Coded Trigger System
**Pros:** Simple implementation, predictable behavior, easy debugging
**Cons:** Inflexible, requires code changes for new secrets, limited scalability
**Implementation:** If/then trigger conditions in dedicated easter egg module

### Approach 3: Event-Driven Discovery System
**Pros:** Responsive to behavior, emergent discoveries, dynamic content
**Cons:** Complex event correlation, potential for false positives
**Implementation:** Health data event streams analyzed for secret patterns
