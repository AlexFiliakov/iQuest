## Quest System Details

### Daily Quest Categories
- **Movement Quests**: Steps, distance, active minutes with thematic descriptions
- **Strength Quests**: Resistance training, muscle groups, workout intensity
- **Mindfulness Quests**: Meditation, sleep quality, stress management
- **Consistency Quests**: Routine building, habit formation, streak maintenance
- **Social Quests**: Group activities, sharing achievements, community engagement

### Epic Quest Chain Examples

#### "The Couch to 5K Kingdom" - A Runner's Journey
- **Chapter 1: The Call to Jogging**: Walk 20 minutes without dying, discover leg muscles exist
- **Chapter 2: The Interval of Trials**: Survive run/walk combinations, befriend asphalt
- **Chapter 3: The Final Sprint**: Run 5K without walking (or excessive cursing)
- **Rewards**: "Runner of Realms" title, Legendary Running Shoes, cardiovascular enlightenment

#### "The Sleep Sanctuary Saga" - Quest for Perfect Rest
- **Quest 1: Banish the Blue Light Demon**: No screens 1 hour before bed (hardest boss)
- **Quest 2: The Caffeine Curfew**: No coffee after 2 PM (requires strong willpower saves)
- **Quest 3: Temple of the Bedroom**: Use bed only for sleep (and that other thing)
- **Rewards**: "Sleeping Beauty" buff - Wake up actually refreshed

### Quest Generation Algorithm
- **Pattern Analysis**: Review last 7-14 days of user activity
- **Weakness Identification**: Find improvement opportunities without shaming
- **Progressive Challenge**: Set goals slightly above current performance
- **Variety Enforcement**: Prevent repetitive quest assignments
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Adjust for weather, holidays, life events

## Technical Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Template-Based Quest Engine (Recommended)
**Pros:** Easy content creation, consistent structure, localization-friendly
**Cons:** May feel formulaic, limited dynamic generation
**Implementation:** Quest templates with variable substitution and condition checking

### Approach 2: Procedural Quest Generation
**Pros:** Infinite variety, adaptive difficulty, emergent storylines
**Cons:** Complex balancing, potential for nonsensical quests, harder to debug
**Implementation:** Algorithm-generated objectives with narrative templates

### Approach 3: Hybrid Template + Procedural
**Pros:** Best of both worlds, structured variety, maintainable complexity
**Cons:** More complex architecture, requires careful balancing
**Implementation:** Template framework with procedural variable generation
