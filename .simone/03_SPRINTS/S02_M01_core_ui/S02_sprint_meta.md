# Sprint S02: Core UI Framework

## Sprint Goal
Build the foundational UI structure with tab-based navigation, warm visual design, and configuration capabilities.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Main Application Window
- **Tab navigation**: Clean tab interface for different views
- **Window management**: Proper sizing, min/max constraints
- **Menu system**: File, View, Help menus
- **Status bar**: Current file, processing status

### 2. Configuration Tab
- **Date range picker**: User-friendly date selection
- **Source filter**: Multi-select list of data sources
- **Type filter**: Hierarchical metric type selection
- **Filter presets**: Save/load common filter combinations

### 3. Visual Design System
- **Color implementation**: Tan background (#F5E6D3), orange/yellow accents
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts at appropriate sizes
- **Icons**: Consistent icon set for actions and navigation
- **Responsive layout**: Adapts to window resizing

### 4. UI Components Library
- **Custom widgets**: Styled buttons, inputs, dropdowns
- **Loading indicators**: Progress bars and spinners
- **Error displays**: User-friendly error messages
- **Tooltips**: Helpful hints throughout UI

## Definition of Done
- [x] Main window launches and displays correctly
- [x] Tab navigation works smoothly
- [x] Configuration filters update data in real-time
- [x] Warm color scheme is applied throughout
- [x] UI is responsive and doesn't freeze
- [x] All text is readable and well-contrasted
- [x] Keyboard navigation is supported
- [x] Window state is saved and restored

## Technical Approach
- **Framework**: PyQt6 (decided and implemented)
- **Styling**: Custom StyleManager with warm theme implemented
- **Layout**: Grid and box layouts for responsiveness
- **Threading**: Background tasks don't block UI

## Dependencies
- Sprint S01: Need data model for filter options

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: UI framework learning curve
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple layouts, iterate
- **Risk**: Cross-platform styling issues
  - **Mitigation**: Test early on Windows versions

## Incorporated General Tasks
The following general tasks have been identified as belonging to this sprint:

### From General Tasks Pool:
1. **GX003_setup_pyqt6_application_skeleton.md** (Completed)
   - Provides PyQt6 foundation for all UI work
   - Creates main window, menu bar, status bar
   - Establishes application architecture

2. **GX004_implement_configuration_tab.md** (Completed)
   - Implements Configuration Tab (Key Deliverable #2)
   - Date range picker, source/type filters
   - Filter presets functionality

3. **GX003_create_basic_ui_framework.md** (Completed)
   - Already implemented tab navigation system
   - Applied warm color scheme
   - Created responsive layout structure

## Sprint Tasks Breakdown
Based on remaining work and general tasks:

1. **Complete PyQt6 Application Skeleton** (GX003) ✅ COMPLETED
   - Main window with menu bar and status bar
   - Tab-based navigation system
   - Application architecture established

2. **Implement Configuration Tab** (GX004) ✅ COMPLETED
   - Date range picker with calendar widgets ✅
   - Multi-select dropdowns for sources and types ✅
   - Filter application and reset functionality ✅
   - Save/load filter presets ✅

3. **Enhance Visual Design System** ⏳ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
   - Refine color implementation across all components ✅
   - Create custom styled widgets (buttons, inputs, dropdowns) ✅
   - Implement loading indicators and progress bars ✅
   - Add tooltips throughout the UI ❌

4. **UI Components Library** ⏳ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
   - Extract reusable components from existing code ✅
   - Create consistent error display widgets ✅
   - Implement keyboard navigation support ❌
   - Add window state persistence ❌

## Remaining Work for Sprint Completion

### Tasks Created for Remaining Work:

1. **G010_implement_keyboard_navigation.md** (Open)
   - Add tab order for all interactive elements
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Ensure all features are accessible via keyboard
   - Complexity: Medium

2. **G011_implement_window_state_persistence.md** (Open)
   - Save window size and position on close
   - Restore window state on application start
   - Remember last active tab
   - Complexity: Low

3. **G012_implement_tooltips_ui.md** (Open)
   - Add helpful tooltips to configuration options
   - Provide context for filter controls
   - Guide users through the interface
   - Complexity: Low

4. **G004_sqlite_database_initialization.md** (In Progress)
   - Complete database schema initialization
   - Ensure proper database integration
   - Test data persistence functionality
   - Complexity: Medium

### Parallel Work Strategy:
- G010, G011, and G012 can be worked on independently
- G004 is already in progress and should be completed first
- All tasks should be completed before marking sprint as done
