# Sprint S02: Core UI Framework

## Sprint Goal
Build the foundational UI structure with tab-based navigation, warm visual design, and configuration capabilities.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Main Application Window
- **Tab navigation**: Clean tab interface for different views
- **Window management**: Proper sizing, min/max constraints
- **Menu system**: File, View, Help menus
- **Status bar**: Current file, processing status

### 2. Configuration Tab
- **Date range picker**: User-friendly date selection
- **Source filter**: Multi-select list of data sources
- **Type filter**: Hierarchical metric type selection
- **Filter presets**: Save/load common filter combinations

### 3. Visual Design System
- **Color implementation**: Tan background (#F5E6D3), orange/yellow accents
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts at appropriate sizes
- **Icons**: Consistent icon set for actions and navigation
- **Responsive layout**: Adapts to window resizing

### 4. UI Components Library
- **Custom widgets**: Styled buttons, inputs, dropdowns
- **Loading indicators**: Progress bars and spinners
- **Error displays**: User-friendly error messages
- **Tooltips**: Helpful hints throughout UI

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Main window launches and displays correctly
- [ ] Tab navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Configuration filters update data in real-time
- [ ] Warm color scheme is applied throughout
- [ ] UI is responsive and doesn't freeze
- [ ] All text is readable and well-contrasted
- [ ] Keyboard navigation is supported
- [ ] Window state is saved and restored

## Technical Approach
- **Framework**: PyQt5 or Tkinter (to be decided)
- **Styling**: Custom stylesheets for warm theme
- **Layout**: Grid and box layouts for responsiveness
- **Threading**: Background tasks don't block UI

## Dependencies
- Sprint S01: Need data model for filter options

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: UI framework learning curve
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple layouts, iterate
- **Risk**: Cross-platform styling issues
  - **Mitigation**: Test early on Windows versions

## Incorporated General Tasks
The following general tasks have been identified as belonging to this sprint:

### From General Tasks Pool:
1. **G003_setup_pyqt6_application_skeleton.md** (Completed)
   - Provides PyQt6 foundation for all UI work
   - Creates main window, menu bar, status bar
   - Establishes application architecture

2. **G004_implement_configuration_tab.md** (Open)
   - Implements Configuration Tab (Key Deliverable #2)
   - Date range picker, source/type filters
   - Filter presets functionality

3. **GX003_create_basic_ui_framework.md** (Completed)
   - Already implemented tab navigation system
   - Applied warm color scheme
   - Created responsive layout structure

## Sprint Tasks Breakdown
