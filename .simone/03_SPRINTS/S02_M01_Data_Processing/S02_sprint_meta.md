# Sprint S02: CSV Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline

## Sprint Goal
Implement robust CSV data import functionality with validation, memory-efficient processing, and data filtering capabilities.

## Deliverables
- [ ] CSV file import with progress indication
- [ ] Data validation and error handling
- [ ] Memory-efficient processing for large files (per ADR-002)
- [ ] Data filtering by date range
- [ ] Data filtering by sourceName and type
- [ ] Filter configuration persistence
- [ ] Basic data statistics calculation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Can import Apple Health CSV files up to 1GB
- [ ] Invalid CSV format shows helpful error messages
- [ ] Progress bar updates during import
- [ ] Filters apply correctly and quickly (<200ms)
- [ ] Filter settings persist between sessions
- [ ] Unit tests cover happy path and error cases
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 500MB for typical files

## Technical Notes
- Implement hybrid memory/streaming approach from ADR-002
- Use pandas for data processing with optimization
- Store filter configurations in SQLite
- Consider chunked reading for files >50MB
- Validate required columns: creationDate, sourceName, type, unit, value

## Risks
- Risk 1: Large file performance - Mitigation: Implement streaming fallback
- Risk 2: Inconsistent CSV formats - Mitigation: Flexible parser with validation
