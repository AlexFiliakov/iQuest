# Sprint S02: XML Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline

## Sprint Goal
Implement robust XML data import functionality with validation, memory-efficient processing, and data filtering capabilities.

## Deliverables
- [x] XML file import with progress indication
- [x] Data validation and error handling
- [x] Memory-efficient processing for large files (per ADR-002)
- [x] Data filtering by date range
- [x] Data filtering by sourceName and type
- [x] Filter configuration persistence
- [x] Basic data statistics calculation

## Definition of Done
- [x] Can import Apple Health XML files up to 1GB
- [x] Invalid XML format shows helpful error messages
- [x] Progress bar updates during import
- [x] Filters apply correctly and quickly (<200ms)
- [x] Filter settings persist between sessions
- [x] Unit tests cover happy path and error cases
- [x] Memory usage stays under 500MB for typical files

## Technical Notes
- Implement hybrid memory/streaming approach from ADR-002
- Use pandas for data processing with optimization
- Store filter configurations in SQLite
- Consider chunked reading for files >50MB
- Validate required columns: creationDate, sourceName, type, unit, value

## Risks
- Risk 1: Large file performance - Mitigation: Implement streaming fallback
- Risk 2: Inconsistent XML formats - Mitigation: Flexible parser with validation
