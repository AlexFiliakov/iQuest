## Critical Path
T01 → T02 → T03 → T04 (parallel with T06) → T08 → T09 → T10

Total estimated duration: 10-12 days with parallel execution

## Resource Allocation Suggestions

### Developer 1 (Database/Backend Focus)
1. T01_S06 - Database Schema
2. T05_S06 - Search Functionality  
3. T07_S06 - Export Functionality

### Developer 2 (UI/Frontend Focus)
1. T02_S06 - Editor Component
2. T03_S06 - Save/Edit Functionality
3. T04_S06 - Auto-Save
4. T09_S06 - Tab Integration

### Developer 3 (Full-Stack)
1. T06_S06 - Journal Indicators
2. T08_S06 - History View
3. T10_S06 - Testing & Documentation

## Risk Mitigation
- T01_S06 is critical - any delays impact entire sprint
- T05_S06 (Search) has performance risks - allocate senior developer
- T07_S06 (Export) may need extra time for PDF formatting
- T10_S06 should start documentation early, not wait until end
