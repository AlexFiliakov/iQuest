# Sprint S06: Journal Note-Taking Functionality

## Sprint Goal
Implement the journal feature that allows users to add contextual notes to their health data at daily, weekly, and monthly levels.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Journal entry UI component with rich text editor
- [ ] Save/edit journal entries for specific dates
- [ ] Weekly and monthly journal entry support
- [ ] Journal entry search functionality
- [ ] Auto-save while typing
- [ ] Journal entry indicators on dashboards
- [ ] Export journal entries (JSON/PDF)
- [ ] Journal entry history view

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Can create/edit/delete journal entries
- [ ] Entries persist between sessions
- [ ] Search finds entries by content
- [ ] Auto-save prevents data loss
- [ ] UI clearly shows which dates have entries
- [ ] Export creates readable documents
- [ ] Performance stays fast with many entries
- [ ] Character limit (10,000) enforced gracefully

## Technical Notes
- Store entries in SQLite with proper indexing

- Use full-text search for entry content
- Consider rich text vs plain text tradeoffs
- Add keyboard shortcuts for quick access
- Ensure proper data sanitization

## Risks
- Risk 1: Data loss from crashes - Mitigation: Aggressive auto-save
- Risk 2: Search performance - Mitigation: SQLite FTS (full-text search)
