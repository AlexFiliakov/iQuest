# Sprint S06: Journal Note-Taking Functionality

## Sprint Goal
Implement the journal feature that allows users to add contextual notes to their health data at daily, weekly, and monthly levels.

## Deliverables
- [x] Journal entry UI component with rich text editor
- [x] Save/edit journal entries for specific dates
- [x] Weekly and monthly journal entry support
- [x] Journal entry search functionality
- [x] Auto-save while typing
- [x] Journal entry indicators on dashboards
- [x] Export journal entries (JSON/PDF)
- [x] Journal entry history view

## Definition of Done
- [x] Can create/edit/delete journal entries
- [x] Entries persist between sessions
- [x] Search finds entries by content
- [x] Auto-save prevents data loss
- [x] UI clearly shows which dates have entries
- [x] Export creates readable documents
- [x] Performance stays fast with many entries
- [x] Character limit (10,000) enforced gracefully

## Technical Notes
- Store entries in SQLite with proper indexing
- Implement auto-save with debouncing
- Use full-text search for entry content
- Consider rich text vs plain text tradeoffs
- Add keyboard shortcuts for quick access
- Ensure proper data sanitization

## Risks
- Risk 1: Data loss from crashes - Mitigation: Aggressive auto-save
- Risk 2: Search performance - Mitigation: SQLite FTS (full-text search)

## Hotfix Tasks
- G085: Fix broken tests (infrastructural hotfix) - Critical test suite repairs needed before continuing sprint work
