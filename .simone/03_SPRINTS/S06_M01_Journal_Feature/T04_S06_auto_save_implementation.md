# Task: Auto-Save Implementation

## Description
Implement auto-save functionality with debouncing to prevent data loss while users type their journal entries. The system should save drafts periodically and indicate save status to users without interrupting their writing flow.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement debounced auto-save (save after 3 seconds of inactivity)
- Show save status indicator in UI
- Handle save conflicts gracefully
- Minimize performance impact while typing
- Recover unsaved work after crashes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auto-save triggers after 3 seconds of no typing
- [ ] Save status indicator shows: "Saving...", "Saved", "Error"
- [ ] Manual save (Ctrl+S) works alongside auto-save
- [ ] No UI freezing during auto-save operations
- [ ] Draft recovery works after application crash
- [ ] Auto-save can be disabled in settings
- [ ] Performance impact <5% while typing
- [ ] Network/database errors don't interrupt typing

## Implementation Analysis

### Debouncing Strategy
**Options:**
1. **Simple Timer Reset** - Reset timer on each keystroke
   - Pros: Easy to implement, predictable behavior
   - Cons: May never save during continuous typing
2. **Hybrid Approach** - Debounce with max interval
   - Pros: Guarantees save within time window, balances responsiveness
   - Cons: More complex state management
3. **Incremental Save** - Save chunks as user types
   - Pros: Minimal data loss, progressive saving
   - Cons: Complex implementation, potential conflicts

**Recommendation:** Hybrid Approach (#2) - Best balance of UX and data safety

### Draft Storage Mechanism
- **Separate Database Table** - journal_drafts table
   - Pros: Clean separation, transaction safety, queryable
   - Cons: Schema maintenance, migration complexity

### Conflict Resolution
- **Version Comparison** - Check timestamps/hashes
   - Pros: Detects conflicts, safe
   - Cons: User intervention needed

## Output Log
[2025-01-28 00:00:00] Task created - Auto-save prevents data loss during journal writing
[2025-06-02 03:54:00] Implemented core auto-save functionality:
  - Created AutoSaveManager with hybrid debouncing (3s delay, 30s max wait)
  - Implemented SaveStatusIndicator with animated status transitions
  - Added journal_drafts table via migration #7
  - Integrated auto-save into JournalEditorWidget
  - Created test script for validation
  - Completed subtasks 1-6, 10 (partial)
[2025-06-02 04:07:00] Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** Due to incomplete implementation of required features
[2025-06-02 05:00:00] Completed missing features:
  - Created DraftRecoveryDialog with full UI for recovering orphaned drafts
  - Enhanced AutoSaveManager with draft recovery methods and signal integration
  - Created AutoSaveSettingsPanel with comprehensive settings UI
  - Integrated draft recovery into JournalEditorWidget
  - Added performance tests to validate <5% impact requirement
  - Created comprehensive demo script for testing all functionality
  - Completed subtasks 8, 9, 11 (conflict resolution, draft recovery, settings)
**Scope:** Task T04_S06 - Auto-Save Implementation for Journal Feature
**Findings:** 
  - Draft Recovery Dialog not implemented (Severity: 7/10) - check_for_drafts() exists but recovery UI missing
  - Conflict Resolution partially implemented (Severity: 5/10) - references exist but integration incomplete
  - Settings Integration incomplete (Severity: 6/10) - only toggle checkbox, no full settings panel
  - Performance validation missing (Severity: 4/10) - tracking exists but no <5% impact validation
  - Extra status indicator states added (Severity: 2/10) - minor deviation but improvements
**Summary:** Core auto-save functionality is well-implemented with proper debouncing, status indication, and draft storage. However, several key features are incomplete including draft recovery UI, full conflict resolution, and settings integration.
**Recommendation:** Complete the missing implementations (subtasks 8, 9, 11) before marking task as done. The core foundation is solid and working correctly.
