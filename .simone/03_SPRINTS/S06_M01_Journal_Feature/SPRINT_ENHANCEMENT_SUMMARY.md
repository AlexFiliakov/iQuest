- Optimized memory usage
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation

**Critical Decisions:**
- Split pane over separate views
- Persistent state management
- Flexible layout system

### T10_S06 - Testing & Documentation ✅
**Key Enhancements:**
- Selected pytest with pytest-qt
- Designed 90%+ coverage strategy
- Implemented Sphinx documentation
- Added performance benchmarks
- Created user and developer guides

**Critical Decisions:**
- pytest over unittest
- Sphinx for documentation
- Automated coverage reporting

## Common Patterns Across Tasks

### Testing Strategy
Each task includes:
1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for system interaction
3. Performance tests with benchmarks
4. UI/UX tests with accessibility checks

### Error Handling
Consistent approach:
1. Graceful degradation
2. User-friendly error messages
3. Technical details for debugging
4. Recovery mechanisms

### Performance Requirements
- Single operations < 100ms
- Batch operations optimized
- Memory usage profiled
- Lazy loading where applicable

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode
- ARIA labels
- Focus management

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority Order
1. T01 - Database foundation (2 days)
2. T02 & T05 - Core components (3 days parallel)
3. T03 & T07 - Save/Export (3 days parallel)
4. T04 & T06 - Enhancements (2 days parallel)
5. T08 & T09 - Integration (2 days)
6. T10 - Testing/Docs (3 days)

### Risk Mitigation
- Start T01 immediately (blocks all others)
- Assign experienced dev to T05 (search complexity)
- Begin T10 documentation early
- Plan for PDF export complexity in T07

### Resource Allocation
- Backend Developer: T01, T05, T07
- Frontend Developer: T02, T03, T04, T09
- Full-Stack Developer: T06, T08, T10

## Success Metrics
- 90%+ test coverage
- All operations < 100ms
- Zero data loss scenarios
- Accessibility compliance
- Complete documentation
