# Task: Build Process Automation and CI/CD Integration

## Description
Implement automated build processes for consistent and repeatable Windows executable generation. This includes creating build scripts, setting up GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds, and implementing version management. The automation should support all three distribution methods outlined in ADR-003.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create comprehensive build automation scripts
- Implement GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- Set up version management integration
- Enable automated builds on version tags
- Establish artifact storage and distribution

## Related Documentation
- ADR-003: Packaging and Distribution Strategy (CI/CD section)
- Existing GitHub Actions workflows in the project

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Build script (build.py) successfully creates all distribution formats
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on version tags
- [x] Version information is automatically extracted from version.py
- [x] Build artifacts are properly stored and accessible
- [x] UPX compression is applied when configured
- [x] Build process is documented and reproducible
- [x] Local and CI builds produce identical results

## Subtasks
- [x] Create build.py script with support for all distribution formats
- [x] Implement version extraction from src/version.py
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow based on ADR-003 template
- [x] Configure UPX compression in build process
- [x] Implement artifact upload and storage
- [x] Add build status badges to README
- [x] Create build configuration file (build_config.json)
- [ ] Test automated builds with different configurations
- [x] Document build process and requirements

## Implementation Guidance

### Build Script Structure (build.py)
```python
# Key features to implement:
# 1. Command-line argument parsing
# 2. Version extraction from src/version.py
# 3. PyInstaller execution with spec file
# 4. UPX compression (optional)
# 5. NSIS installer creation
# 6. Portable ZIP creation
# 7. Build artifact organization
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Based on ADR-003, the workflow should:
- Trigger on: push to tags matching `v*`
- Set up Python environment
- Install dependencies
- Run tests (ensure they pass)
- Execute build script
- Upload artifacts
- Create GitHub release (optional)

### Version Management
- Extract version from `src/version.py`
- Embed version in:
  - Executable metadata
  - Installer
  - File names
  - About dialog

### Build Configurations
Support multiple build configurations:
- Debug build (with console)
- Release build (no console)
- Portable build (different data paths)

### Directory Structure for Builds
```
build/
├── dist/
│   ├── AppleHealthMonitor.exe
│   ├── AppleHealthMonitor-portable.zip
│   └── AppleHealthMonitor-installer.exe
├── work/
│   └── (temporary build files)
└── logs/
    └── build-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log
```
