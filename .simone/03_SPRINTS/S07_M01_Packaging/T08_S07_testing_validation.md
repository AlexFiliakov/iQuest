# Task: Comprehensive Packaging Testing and Validation

## Description
Perform thorough testing of all packaged distribution formats on clean Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. This includes validating that all features work correctly in the packaged form, verifying performance meets requirements, and ensuring the journal persistence functionality works as expected. Testing should cover installation, runtime, updates, and uninstallation scenarios.

## Goal / Objectives
- Test all three distribution formats on clean systems
- Verify all application features work when packaged
- Validate performance requirements are met
- Ensure data persistence works correctly
- Test update scenarios
- Document any packaging-specific issues
- Create automated packaging tests where possible

## Related Documentation
- Sprint S07 Meta: Performance requirement of <5 second startup
- ADR-003: Testing requirements for packaging
- Existing test infrastructure in tests/

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All distribution formats install correctly on Windows 10/11
- [ ] Application starts in under 5 seconds
- [ ] All features work identically to development version
- [ ] Journal entries persist across application restarts
- [ ] Data import/export functions correctly
- [ ] Charts and visualizations render properly
- [ ] No missing dependencies or DLL errors
- [ ] Portable version maintains data isolation
- [ ] Update process works smoothly
- [ ] Uninstallation is clean and complete

## Subtasks
- [x] Set up clean Windows 10 and 11 test environments
- [x] Create packaging test checklist
- [ ] Test direct executable on both OS versions
- [ ] Test NSIS installer (with/without admin rights)
- [ ] Test portable ZIP version
- [ ] Verify all UI features and interactions
- [ ] Test data persistence and journal functionality
- [ ] Measure and document startup times
- [ ] Test update scenarios for each format

### Automated Testing Script
```python
# tests/packaging/test_packaged_app.py
import subprocess
import time
import psutil
import os

class PackagedAppTests:
    def __init__(self, exe_path):
        self.exe_path = exe_path
        
    def test_startup_time(self):
        """Test application startup time."""
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Launch application
        process = subprocess.Popen([self.exe_path])
        
        # Wait for window to appear
        while not self.is_window_visible():
            time.sleep(0.1)
            
        startup_time = time.time() - start_time
        assert startup_time < 5.0, f"Startup took {startup_time}s (>5s limit)"
        
        process.terminate()
        return startup_time
        
    def test_memory_usage(self):
        """Test memory usage of packaged app."""
        process = subprocess.Popen([self.exe_path])
        time.sleep(5)  # Let app fully load
        
        # Get process memory info
        p = psutil.Process(process.pid)
        memory_mb = p.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
        
        assert memory_mb < 500, f"Memory usage {memory_mb}MB exceeds limit"
        
        process.terminate()
        return memory_mb

        "chart_render": []
    }
    
    # Run multiple iterations
    for i in range(5):
        # Test startup
        start = time.time()
        # ... launch and measure
        results["startup_time"].append(elapsed)
        
    # Calculate averages
