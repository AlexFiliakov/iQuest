# Sprint S07: Windows Executable Packaging & Deployment

## Sprint Goal
Package the application as a professional Windows executable with installer, ensuring easy distribution and installation for non-technical users.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Implement remaining tasks in `G064_visualization_performance_optimization.md`
- [ ] PyInstaller configuration and build script
- [ ] Windows executable with icon and metadata
  - Executable icon is based on the "heart on fire" emoji: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
- [ ] NSIS installer with proper UI
- [ ] Portable ZIP version option
- [ ] Code signing implementation
- [ ] User documentation (PDF/HTML)
- [ ] Installation troubleshooting guide

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Executable runs on clean Windows 10/11
- [ ] Installer completes without admin rights
- [ ] Simple process for creating updated executables for the latest version
- [ ] No antivirus false positives (or documented)
- [ ] Startup time under 5 seconds
- [ ] All features work in packaged version
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Technical Notes
- Follow ADR-003 packaging strategy
- Use UPX compression for size reduction
- Include all assets and dependencies
- Test on multiple Windows versions
- Implement crash reporting
- Add version info and metadata
- Create automated build pipeline

## Risks
- Risk 1: Antivirus false positives - Mitigation: Code signing, vendor submission
- Risk 2: Missing dependencies - Mitigation: Thorough testing, hidden imports

## Tasks

1. **T01_S07_pyinstaller_configuration.md** - Create PyInstaller spec file and basic build setup
2. **T02_S07_build_automation.md** - Implement automated build pipeline and CI/CD integration
3. **T03_S07_distribution_formats.md** - Create all three distribution methods (exe, installer, portable)
4. **T04_S07_code_signing.md** - Implement code signing and security measures
5. **T05_S07_auto_update_system.md** - Build auto-update functionality for future releases
6. **T06_S07_user_documentation.md** - Create end-user documentation (PDF/HTML)
7. **T07_S07_troubleshooting_guide.md** - Create installation troubleshooting documentation
8. **T08_S07_testing_validation.md** - Comprehensive packaging testing on Windows 10/11
9. **T09_S07_release_preparation.md** - Final release preparation and documentation

## ADR References
- ADR-003: Packaging and Distribution Strategy (primary technical guidance)

## Notes
- The G064 visualization performance optimization task mentioned in deliverables was not found in the codebase and has been excluded from task creation
- All tasks include comprehensive implementation guidance and reference ADR-003 where relevant
- Focus is on creating a professional Windows distribution with multiple formats to serve different user needs
