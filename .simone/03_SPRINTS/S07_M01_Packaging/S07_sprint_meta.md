# Sprint S07: Windows Executable Packaging & Deployment

## Sprint Goal
Package the application as a professional Windows executable with installer, ensuring easy distribution and installation for non-technical users.

## Deliverables
- [ ] PyInstaller configuration and build script
- [ ] Windows executable with icon and metadata
- [ ] NSIS installer with proper UI
- [ ] Portable ZIP version option
- [ ] Code signing implementation
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism
- [ ] User documentation (PDF/HTML)
- [ ] Installation troubleshooting guide

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Executable runs on clean Windows 10/11
- [ ] Installer completes without admin rights
- [ ] No antivirus false positives (or documented)
- [ ] File size under 100MB (compressed)
- [ ] Startup time under 5 seconds
- [ ] All features work in packaged version
- [ ] Update check works correctly
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Technical Notes
- Follow ADR-003 packaging strategy
- Use UPX compression for size reduction
- Include all assets and dependencies
- Test on multiple Windows versions
- Implement crash reporting
- Add version info and metadata
- Create automated build pipeline

## Risks
- Risk 1: Antivirus false positives - Mitigation: Code signing, vendor submission
- Risk 2: Missing dependencies - Mitigation: Thorough testing, hidden imports
