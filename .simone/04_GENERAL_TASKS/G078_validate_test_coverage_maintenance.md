# Validate Test Coverage Maintenance

## Description
Verify that the test consolidation efforts have maintained or improved code coverage while reducing test count. Run comprehensive coverage analysis before and after consolidation to ensure no functionality coverage has been lost during the optimization process.

## Goal / Objectives
- Verify test coverage is maintained at 90%+ after consolidation
- Identify any coverage gaps introduced during test distribution
- Document coverage improvements from better test organization
- Ensure all critical code paths remain tested

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code coverage maintained at 90%+ across all modules
- [ ] Coverage report comparison between original and consolidated tests
- [ ] No critical functionality left untested after consolidation
- [ ] Coverage gaps identified and addressed
- [ ] Coverage documentation updated with new test structure
- [ ] Automated coverage monitoring implemented

## Subtasks
- [ ] Run coverage analysis on original test suite (using backup files)
- [ ] Run coverage analysis on consolidated test suite
- [ ] Compare coverage reports to identify gaps
- [ ] Create coverage gap analysis tool
- [ ] Add tests to cover any identified gaps
- [ ] Document coverage improvements from consolidation
- [ ] Set up automated coverage reporting
- [ ] Create coverage regression prevention
