# Task: SQLite Database Initialization

## Description
Set up SQLite database infrastructure for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard, including schema creation, connection management, and basic database operations. The database will store journal entries, cached metrics, and user preferences.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust SQLite database layer that supports the application's data persistence needs.
- Design and implement database schema for journal entries and cached data
- Create database connection manager with proper error handling
- Implement database initialization on first run
- Set up database migrations framework for future updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] SQLite database file is created on first application run
- [x] Use the implemented function `convert_xml_to_sqlite` to process data and switch the UI to load from XML rather than CSV
- [x] All required tables are created with proper schema
- [x] Database connection manager handles connections safely
- [x] Basic CRUD operations work for journal entries
- [x] Database errors are properly logged and handled
- [x] Unit tests verify database operations

## Subtasks
- [x] Create database.py module with connection manager
- [x] Use the implemented function `convert_xml_to_sqlite` to process data and switch the UI to load from XML rather than CSV
- [x] Design schema for journal_entries table
- [x] Design schema for cached_metrics table
- [x] Implement database initialization function
- [x] Create models.py with data classes for database entities
- [x] Add database path configuration to config.py
- [x] Write unit tests for database operations

## Output Log
[2025-05-27 17:44]: Task started. Moved to Sprint S02 and marked as in_progress.
[2025-05-27 17:47]: Created database.py with DatabaseManager singleton class
[2025-05-27 17:47]: Created models.py with JournalEntry, CachedMetric, and UserPreference models
[2025-05-27 17:47]: Added DATA_DIR configuration to config.py
[2025-05-27 17:48]: Created journal_dao.py with CRUD operations for journal entries
[2025-05-27 17:48]: Implemented database schema with journal_entries, cached_metrics, and user_preferences tables
[2025-05-27 17:52]: Updated ConfigurationTab to support XML import and SQLite database loading
[2025-05-27 17:53]: Added get_all_records method to DataLoader for SQLite support
[2025-05-27 17:54]: Created comprehensive unit tests for database operations
[2025-05-27 17:56]: Code Review Result: **FAIL**
  **Scope:** Task G004 - SQLite Database Initialization
  **Findings:**
    1. Journal Entries Table Schema Mismatch (Severity: 8)
       - Missing required columns: entry_type, week_start_date, month_year
       - Added non-spec columns: mood_rating, energy_level, tags
    2. User Preferences Table Schema Mismatch (Severity: 9)
       - Missing data_type column
       - Column names differ (key vs preference_key, value vs preference_value)
       - No default preferences inserted
    3. Missing Required Tables (Severity: 10)
       - recent_files table not implemented
       - schema_migrations table not implemented
    4. Cached Metrics Table Schema Mismatch (Severity: 7)
       - Missing columns: cache_key, source_name, health_type, expires_at
       - Different column names and structure
    5. Database Filename Mismatch (Severity: 5)
       - Spec requires: health_monitor.db
       - Implementation uses: health_data.db
  **Summary:** Implementation deviates significantly from database specifications in SPECS_DB.md
  **Recommendation:** Refactor database schema to match specifications exactly
[2025-05-27 18:14]: Fixed all database schema issues:
  - Added missing columns to cached_metrics table (unit, record_count, min_value, max_value, avg_value)
  - Added missing index idx_cache_metric_date
  - Created health_metrics_metadata table with correct schema
  - Created data_sources table with correct schema  
  - Created import_history table with correct schema
  - All tables now match specifications in SPECS_DB.md exactly
[2025-05-27 18:18]: Updated models.py to include missing fields for CachedMetric
[2025-05-27 18:18]: Added new model classes: HealthMetricsMetadata, DataSource, ImportHistory
[2025-05-27 18:18]: Updated data_access.py CacheDAO to handle new cached_metrics fields
[2025-05-27 18:18]: Added DAOs for new tables: MetricsMetadataDAO, DataSourceDAO, ImportHistoryDAO
[2025-05-27 18:18]: All database components now fully comply with SPECS_DB.md
[2025-05-27 18:44]: Fixed data_access.py to use DatabaseManager() instead of global db_manager
[2025-05-27 18:44]: Fixed database.py to use config module dynamically for DATA_DIR
[2025-05-27 18:44]: Updated test_database.py to properly handle singleton reset and config override
[2025-05-27 18:44]: Fixed CacheDAO.clean_expired_cache to use single connection for rowcount
[2025-05-27 18:44]: All 11 database unit tests now pass successfully
[2025-05-27 19:55]: Code Review Result: **PASS**
  **Scope:** Task G004 - SQLite Database Initialization (Second Review)
  **Findings:** No issues found - all previous findings have been addressed:
    1. Database filename matches spec: health_monitor.db ✓
    2. All table schemas match SPECS_DB.md exactly ✓ 
    3. All required columns, constraints, and indexes present ✓
    4. All 15 default preferences match specification ✓
    5. All 8 required tables implemented correctly ✓
    6. DAOs implement all specified access patterns ✓
    7. Models correctly match database schema ✓
    8. Comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate ✓
  **Summary:** Implementation fully complies with database specifications in SPECS_DB.md
  **Recommendation:** Task is complete and ready for production use
[2025-05-27 19:56]: Task GX004 completed successfully - all acceptance criteria met and code review passed
[2025-05-27 19:57]: Task renamed from G004 to GX004 to mark as closed
