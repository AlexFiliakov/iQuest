# Establish Performance Benchmark for Test Suite

## Description
Create comprehensive performance benchmarks for the test suite to measure the impact of consolidation efforts. Establish baseline metrics for test execution time, collection time, and resource usage to validate the 35% performance improvement target.

## Goal / Objectives
- Establish baseline performance metrics for current test suite
- Measure execution time improvements from consolidation
- Create automated performance monitoring for ongoing test optimization
- Validate 35% test execution time improvement target

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics documented for all test categories
- [ ] Test execution time measured before/after consolidation
- [ ] Performance improvement of 35%+ in test execution time achieved
- [ ] Automated performance monitoring tools created
- [ ] Performance regression detection implemented
- [ ] Performance results documented and validated

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create performance measurement tool for test execution
- [ ] Measure baseline performance for unit tests, integration tests, UI tests
- [ ] Benchmark test collection time across different categories
- [ ] Measure memory usage during test execution
- [ ] Document performance impact of base test classes
- [ ] Create performance regression detection for CI/CD
- [ ] Generate performance improvement report
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring dashboard
