# Task: Testing Implementation Strategy for 90%+ Coverage

## Description
Implement a comprehensive testing strategy to achieve 90%+ code coverage (both statement and branch coverage) across the Apple Health Monitor codebase. The current coverage is at 5.4%, requiring significant test development to reach the target. This task involves creating a systematic approach to test implementation, establishing testing patterns, and building out the test suite infrastructure.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a testing implementation strategy and framework to achieve comprehensive code coverage.
- Define a phased approach to reach 90%+ statement coverage
- Establish testing patterns and infrastructure for maintainable tests
- Create reusable test fixtures and utilities

- Document testing best practices specific to this codebase

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Testing strategy document with clear phases and milestones
- [ ] Test infrastructure established (fixtures, mocks, helpers)
- [ ] Coverage monitoring automated with minimum thresholds
- [ ] Testing patterns documented for each component type
- [ ] Initial test implementation achieving 30%+ coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updated with coverage gates

## Subtasks
### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Foundation)

### Phase 2: Core Module Testing (Target: 30% coverage)
- [ ] Test data models and database operations
- [ ] Test configuration and settings management
- [ ] Test data loader and XML processing
- [ ] Test error handling and logging utilities
- [ ] Test core business logic and calculations
- [ ] Create integration tests for data pipeline

### Phase 3: Analytics Testing (Target: 60% coverage)
- [ ] Test daily/weekly/monthly calculators
- [ ] Test cache manager and performance optimizations
- [ ] Test anomaly detection and correlation analysis
- [ ] Test health score calculation system
- [ ] Test predictive analytics engine
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for analytics

### Phase 4: UI Testing (Target: 90% coverage)
- [ ] Test PyQt6 main window and navigation
- [ ] Test configuration and settings UI
- [ ] Test chart components and visualizations
- [ ] Test dashboard layouts and interactions
- [ ] Test accessibility compliance
- [ ] Create visual regression tests

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for coverage
- [ ] Create coverage trend reporting
- [ ] Document testing patterns and examples
- [ ] Optimize test execution time
- [ ] Establish test maintenance procedures

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
**Test Infrastructure Files**:
- `tests/conftest.py` - Global pytest configuration
- `tests/fixtures/database.py` - Database setup/teardown
- `tests/fixtures/factories.py` - Data object factories
- `tests/generators/health_data.py` - Health data generation

**Coverage Configuration**:
- `pytest.ini` - Coverage settings already configured
- `pyproject.toml` - Coverage tool configuration
- `coverage_analysis/automated_coverage_monitor.py` - Monitoring tools

**Existing Patterns to Follow**:
- Error handling: See `src/utils/error_handler.py` decorators
- Database fixtures: Thread-safe singleton pattern in `src/database.py`
- Mock data: Use factories pattern from documentation
- PyQt6 testing: pytest-qt fixtures for UI components

### Implementation Notes

**Testing Approaches by Component Type**:

1. **Database Operations** (`src/database.py`, `src/data_access.py`):
   - Use transaction rollback for test isolation
   - Create in-memory SQLite for fast tests
   - Mock file I/O operations

2. **Calculators** (`src/analytics/*_calculator.py`):
   - Use parameterized tests for edge cases
   - Test with generated time series data
   - Verify mathematical accuracy

3. **UI Components** (`src/ui/*.py`):
   - Use pytest-qt's qtbot fixture
   - Test signals/slots connections
   - Verify accessibility compliance

4. **Data Processing** (`src/data_loader.py`, `src/xml_streaming_processor.py`):
   - Test with sample XML files
   - Mock large file scenarios
   - Test streaming vs batch modes

### Testing Patterns from Codebase

**Fixture Pattern** (from testing guide):
```python
@pytest.fixture
def health_db(tmp_path):
    """Create temporary database for testing."""
    db_path = tmp_path / "test.db"
    db = HealthDatabase(str(db_path))
    yield db
    db.close()
```

**Mock Pattern** (for external dependencies):
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_data_access(mocker):
    """Mock DataAccess for isolated testing."""
    mock = mocker.Mock(spec=DataAccess)
    mock.get_health_records.return_value = []
    return mock
```

**Parametrized Testing** (for calculators):
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("metric,expected", [
    ("steps", {"mean": 8000, "std": 1200}),
    ("heart_rate", {"mean": 72, "std": 8}),
])
def test_calculator(metric, expected):
    # Test implementation
```

### Error Handling Approach
- Use custom exceptions from `src/utils/error_handler.py`
- Test error decorators: `@handle_errors`, `@validate_inputs`
- Verify logging output with `caplog` fixture

### Performance Testing Approach
- Use `tests/performance/benchmark_base.py` as foundation
- Set baseline metrics for critical operations
- Monitor memory usage with memory_profiler

## Coverage Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Priority Modules (Week 1)
1. `src/models.py` - Core data models (7 dataclasses)
2. `src/database.py` - Database operations
3. `src/config.py` - Configuration constants
4. `src/utils/error_handler.py` - Error handling
5. `src/statistics_calculator.py` - Statistical calculations

### High-Value Targets (Week 2-3)
1. `src/analytics/daily_metrics_calculator.py`
2. `src/analytics/cache_manager.py`
3. `src/data_loader.py`
4. `src/ui/main_window.py`
5. `src/ui/configuration_tab.py`

### Systematic Expansion (Week 4+)
- Complete analytics package (38 modules)
- Cover UI components systematically
- Add integration tests for workflows
- Implement visual regression tests

## Tradeoffs and Approaches

### Approach 1: Bottom-Up (Recommended)
**Pros**: 
- Solid foundation for higher-level tests
- Easier to achieve high coverage on utilities
- Less complex mocking required

**Cons**:
- User-facing features tested later
- May miss integration issues early

### Approach 2: Top-Down
**Pros**:
- Tests user workflows immediately
- Finds integration issues early
- Business value demonstrated quickly

**Cons**:
- Requires extensive mocking
- More complex test setup
- Harder to isolate failures

### Approach 3: Risk-Based
**Pros**:
- Focuses on critical/complex code first
- Maximum impact on quality
- Efficient use of resources

**Cons**:
- May leave gaps in simple code
- Requires careful analysis
- Coverage may be uneven

### Recommended Hybrid Approach
1. Start with core utilities and models (bottom-up)
2. Add critical path integration tests (top-down)
3. Focus on high-risk calculators and data processing
4. Expand systematically to achieve coverage targets

## Dependencies
- Existing test documentation in `docs/testing_guide.md`
- Coverage analysis tools in `coverage_analysis/`
- Test fixture patterns from project documentation
- CI/CD configuration in `.github/workflows/`
