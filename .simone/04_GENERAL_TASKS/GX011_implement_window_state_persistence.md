# Task: Implement Window State Persistence

## Description
Add functionality to save and restore the application window state between sessions. This includes window size, position, maximized state, and the last active tab. The state should be stored using Qt's QSettings for platform-appropriate storage.

## Goal / Objectives
- Save window geometry and state on application close
- Restore window to previous state on application start
- Remember user's last active tab
- Provide seamless user experience across sessions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Window size is saved and restored correctly
- [x] Window position is saved and restored (with screen bounds checking)
- [x] Maximized/normal state is preserved
- [x] Last active tab is remembered and restored
- [x] Settings are stored in appropriate location per OS
- [x] Handles edge cases (e.g., screen resolution changes)
- [x] First-time launch uses sensible defaults

## Subtasks
- [x] Create settings manager using QSettings
- [x] Implement window geometry save on close event
- [x] Implement window geometry restore on startup
- [x] Add last active tab tracking
- [x] Implement screen bounds validation
- [x] Handle multi-monitor scenarios
- [x] Add settings for default window size
- [ ] Test on different screen resolutions
- [x] Add settings reset option in preferences
