# Task: Basic Data Statistics Calculator

## Description
Implement basic statistics calculation for imported health data. This provides users with immediate insights about their data including record counts, date ranges, and basic aggregations by type and source.

## Goal / Objectives
- Calculate basic statistics on imported data
- Show record counts by type and source
- Display date range of available data
- Provide quick data quality insights

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Total record count displayed after import
- [x] Date range (earliest to latest) calculated
- [x] Record counts grouped by type
- [x] Record counts grouped by sourceName
- [x] Statistics update when filters change
- [x] Performance remains fast for large datasets

## Subtasks
- [x] Design statistics data structure
- [x] Implement record counting queries
- [x] Create date range calculation
- [x] Add grouping by type and source
- [x] Create statistics display widget
- [x] Optimize queries with appropriate indexes
- [x] Add unit tests for calculations
- [x] Fix error handling for date parsing in statistics_calculator
- [x] Fix direct database connection access issue
- [x] Add null checks for date formatting in statistics_widget
