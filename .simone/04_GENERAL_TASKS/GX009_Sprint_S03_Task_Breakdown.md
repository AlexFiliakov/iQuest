## Analytics Design Principles

### Visual Excellence
- **Data-Ink Ratio**: Maximize meaningful information, minimize visual clutter
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with key insights, allow drilling down for details
- **Emotional Design**: Use warm colors (#FF8C42, #FFD166) for positive trends, subtle grays for context
- **Microinteractions**: Smooth hover states, gentle animations (200-300ms transitions)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)

### Analytics Best Practices
- **Context Over Numbers**: Always show comparisons (vs yesterday, last week, personal best)
- **Storytelling**: Guide users through their health journey with narrative elements
- **Actionable Insights**: Highlight anomalies and suggest interpretations
- **Personal Records**: Celebrate achievements with subtle animations
- **Confidence Indicators**: Show data quality/completeness visually

### Performance Guidelines
- **Lazy Loading**: Load visible charts first, defer others
- **Incremental Rendering**: Show skeleton states, then fill with data
- **Smart Caching**: Cache calculations at multiple granularities
- **Background Processing**: Pre-calculate common aggregations
- **Memory Management**: Use generators for large datasets
