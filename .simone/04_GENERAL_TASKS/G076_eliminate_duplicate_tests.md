# Eliminate Remaining Duplicate Tests

## Description
Use the test coverage analysis tool to systematically eliminate the 192 identified duplicate tests. Apply parametrized testing patterns and base test classes to consolidate similar test implementations while maintaining coverage.

## Goal / Objectives
- Reduce the 192 identified duplicate tests to fewer than 50
- Achieve 25-30% overall test count reduction from current 2162 tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage while removing duplicates
- Apply consistent testing patterns using base test classes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Duplicate test count reduced from 192 to <50
- [ ] Overall test count reduced by 25-30% (target: ~1500-1600 tests)
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at 90%+ after consolidation
- [ ] All consolidated tests use base test class patterns
- [ ] Parametrized tests replace repetitive test functions
- [ ] Test execution time improved by consolidation

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze test_analysis_report.json to categorize duplicate types
- [ ] Create parametrized test patterns for calculator tests
- [ ] Consolidate analytics tests using BaseAnalyticsTest
- [ ] Merge similar data processing tests using BaseDataProcessingTest
- [ ] Remove redundant error handling tests
- [ ] Consolidate fixture usage across test files
- [ ] Validate coverage is maintained after each consolidation batch
- [ ] Update test markers for consolidated tests
