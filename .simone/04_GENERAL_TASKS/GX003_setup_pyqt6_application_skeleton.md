# Task: Setup PyQt6 Application Skeleton

## Description
Create the basic PyQt6 application skeleton with main window, application structure, and foundational UI components for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard. This will serve as the foundation for all UI development.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a working PyQt6 application with proper architecture and basic window management.
- Create main application window with proper sizing and title
- Implement basic menu bar and status bar
- Set up application-wide styling foundation
- Establish Qt signal/slot patterns for future development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PyQt6 application launches without errors
- [x] Main window displays with correct title and size
- [x] Basic menu structure is in place (File, View, Help)
- [x] Status bar shows basic information
- [x] Application closes cleanly
- [x] Code follows PyQt6 best practices

## Subtasks
- [x] Install PyQt6 in requirements.txt
- [x] Create main_window.py with QMainWindow subclass
- [x] Implement basic menu bar with standard menus
- [x] Add status bar with placeholder text
- [x] Update main.py to launch PyQt6 application
- [x] Add basic error handling for Qt initialization
- [x] Create config.py for UI constants (window size, title, etc.)

## Output Log
[2025-05-27 16:47]: Verified PyQt6>=6.5.0 is already in requirements.txt
[2025-05-27 16:47]: Found main_window.py with comprehensive QMainWindow implementation
[2025-05-27 16:47]: Confirmed menu bar implementation with File, View, and Help menus
[2025-05-27 16:47]: Status bar implemented and shows "Ready" by default
[2025-05-27 16:47]: main.py configured to launch PyQt6 application with proper exception handling
[2025-05-27 16:47]: Error handling includes custom exception hook and ErrorContext wrapper
[2025-05-27 16:48]: Created config.py with application constants and settings
[2025-05-27 16:49]: All acceptance criteria met - PyQt6 skeleton is fully implemented
[2025-05-27 16:50]: CODE REVIEW RESULTS:
Result: **PASS**
**Scope:** Task G003 - Setup PyQt6 Application Skeleton
**Findings:** No issues found
**Summary:** The only code change was creating config.py as requested in the task subtasks. All constants added are appropriate and align with project requirements (window sizes, app metadata, file size limits matching architecture docs).
**Recommendation:** Task completed successfully. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-05-27 16:53]: Updated main_window.py to use config.py constants for window settings
[2025-05-27 16:53]: Updated main.py to use config.py constants for app metadata
