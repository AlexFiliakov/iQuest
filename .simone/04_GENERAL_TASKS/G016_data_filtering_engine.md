# Task: Data Filtering Engine Implementation

## Description
Implement the core data filtering engine that allows users to filter imported health data by date range, sourceName, and type. This engine must be performant (<200ms response time) and support complex filter combinations.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create flexible filtering system for health data
- Support date range, sourceName, and type filters
- Ensure filter operations complete in <200ms
- Enable filter combination with AND/OR logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Date range filtering works correctly
- [ ] SourceName filtering supports multiple selections
- [ ] Type filtering supports multiple selections
- [ ] Filters apply in <200ms for typical datasets
- [ ] Filter logic can combine multiple criteria

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design filter query builder architecture
- [ ] Implement date range filter logic
- [ ] Create sourceName filter with multi-select
- [ ] Create type filter with multi-select
- [ ] Optimize filter queries with indexes
- [ ] Add filter performance monitoring
- [ ] Create unit tests for filter combinations
