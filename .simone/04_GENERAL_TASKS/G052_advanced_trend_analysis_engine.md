# Task G052: Advanced Trend Analysis Engine

## Description
Build sophisticated trend analysis engine that identifies patterns, predicts future values, and provides actionable insights. Includes seasonal decomposition, trend classification, and confidence intervals for predictions.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement seasonal trend decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)
- [ ] Create trend classification system (improving, declining, stable, volatile)
- [ ] Build short-term prediction models (1-7 day forecasts)
- [ ] Add confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- [ ] Implement change point detection for trend shifts
- [ ] Create trend strength scoring and significance testing
- [ ] Build comparative trend analysis across metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurately decomposes time series into trend/seasonal/residual components
- [ ] Classifies trends with confidence scores (0-100%)
- [ ] Provides 1-7 day predictions with confidence intervals
- [ ] Detects significant trend changes and breakpoints
- [ ] Handles missing data and irregular sampling gracefully
- [ ] Provides statistical significance testing for trends
- [ ] Generates human-readable trend summaries
- [ ] Performance: < 200ms for 1 year of daily data per metric

## Technical Details

### Trend Analysis Components
- **Decomposition**: STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess)
- **Classification**: Linear regression with Mann-Kendall test
- **Prediction**: ARIMA models with confidence intervals
- **Change Detection**: CUSUM and Bayesian change point detection
- **Significance**: Statistical tests for trend strength

### Analysis Methods
- **Trend Strength**: RÂ² from linear regression, Theil-Sen slope
- **Seasonality**: Fourier analysis, autocorrelation functions
- **Volatility**: Rolling standard deviation, coefficient of variation
- **Anomalies**: Isolation Forest, statistical outliers

### Output Format
```python
@dataclass
class TrendAnalysis:
    trend_direction: str  # "increasing", "decreasing", "stable"
    trend_strength: float  # 0-1 strength score
    confidence: float  # 0-100% confidence in classification
    seasonal_component: bool  # Has seasonal patterns
    volatility_level: str  # "low", "medium", "high"
    predictions: List[PredictionPoint]  # Future predictions
    change_points: List[datetime]  # Detected trend changes
    summary: str  # Human-readable description
```

## Dependencies
- Daily metrics calculator (G019)
- Statistical libraries (scipy, statsmodels)
- Data filtering engine (G016)

## Implementation Notes
```python
class TrendAnalysisEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decomposition_models = {}
        self.prediction_models = {}
        
    def analyze_trend(self, data: pd.Series, metric_name: str) -> TrendAnalysis:
        """Comprehensive trend analysis for a metric"""
        pass
        
    def decompose_series(self, data: pd.Series) -> Dict[str, pd.Series]:
        """STL decomposition into trend/seasonal/residual"""
        pass
        
    def classify_trend(self, trend_component: pd.Series) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Classify trend direction and strength"""
        pass
        
    def predict_values(self, data: pd.Series, periods: int = 7) -> List[PredictionPoint]:
        """Generate predictions with confidence intervals"""
        pass
        
    def detect_change_points(self, data: pd.Series) -> List[datetime]:
        """Detect significant trend changes"""
        pass
```

## Notes
- Handle irregular time series and missing data appropriately
- Provide both statistical and practical significance measures
- Consider metric-specific trend patterns (e.g., seasonal sleep patterns)
- Include uncertainty quantification in all predictions
