# Task: Setup Python Project Structure

## Description
Initialize the Python project structure with proper directory organization, virtual environment setup, and basic configuration files for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard executable project.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a well-organized Python project foundation that supports development of a Windows executable dashboard application.
- Create standard Python project directory structure
- Set up virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Initialize version control and project configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Project has standard Python directory structure (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
- [x] Virtual environment is created and activated
- [x] requirements.txt file exists with initial dependencies
- [x] .gitignore configured for Python projects
- [x] Basic README.md created with project overview

## Subtasks
- [x] Create main project directories (src/, tests/, docs/, data/)
- [x] Initialize Python virtual environment
- [x] Create requirements.txt with pandas as initial dependency
- [x] Set up .gitignore for Python/PyCharm/VSCode
- [x] Create initial README.md
- [x] Create src/__init__.py and main.py entry point
