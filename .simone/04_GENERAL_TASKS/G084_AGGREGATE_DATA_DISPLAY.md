# G084: Fix Aggregate Data Display Pipeline to Dashboard Tabs

**Task ID**: G084  
**Created**: 2025-05-30 21:47:00  
**Status**: in_progress  
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Updated**: 2025-05-30 10:57  

## Context and Background

The Apple Health Monitor Dashboard currently has a critical data flow issue where only the Configuration tab displays imported health data, while all other dashboard tabs (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Compare, Insights, Records) remain empty. This prevents users from accessing the comprehensive analytics and visualizations that the application provides.

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, the issue stems from inconsistent calculator initialization patterns, signal propagation timing problems, and lack of centralized data management across the multi-tab interface.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Calculator Initialization Problems**
   - Dashboard widgets are constructed with `None` calculators in `main_window.py:1809-1835`
   - Widgets fail silently when no calculator is provided (daily_dashboard_widget.py:686-728)
   - Race conditions between data loading and widget initialization

2. **Signal Propagation Timing Issues**
   - `data_loaded` signal only refreshes currently active tab (main_window.py:1809-1835)
   - Configuration tab only emits `data_loaded` when filters are applied, not on initial data import
   - Non-visible tabs never receive data until manually switched to

3. **Missing Data Propagation Architecture**
   - No centralized data manager for consistent state across tabs
   - Each widget attempts independent data access
   - Missing refresh mechanisms when data changes

## Requirements and Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Fix Data Flow**: Ensure all dashboard tabs receive aggregated data when imported
2. **Centralize Data Management**: Implement consistent data propagation pattern
3. **Improve User Experience**: Provide clear loading states and error messages
4. **Maintain Performance**: Preserve existing caching and optimization patterns

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Standardize Widget Initialization**: Consistent patterns across all dashboard widgets
2. **Add Data Availability Indicators**: Visual feedback for data loading states
3. **Improve Error Handling**: User-visible error messages for data issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All dashboard tabs display relevant aggregated data after data import
- [ ] Data refreshes across all tabs when filters are applied in Configuration tab
- [ ] Loading states are visible during data processing
- [ ] Error states are clearly communicated to users
- [ ] Tab switching maintains data consistency

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Signal-driven architecture properly propagates data to all widgets

   - Implement progressive enhancement rather than architectural overhaul

2. **Database Health & Data Verification**
   - Address potential database schema issues
   - Verify data availability at the database level before propagating
   - Incorporate database health checks in startup sequence
   - Add validation layer to ensure data quality before propagation

3. **Configuration Tab Signal Emission**
   - Emit `data_loaded` signal immediately when database data is available
   - Separate initial data loading from filter application
   - Add data validation before signal emission

4. **Enhanced Error Handling & Debugging**
   - Include automatic retry logic for transient failures
   - Implement data state debugging tools for troubleshooting
