# Task: XML Data Validation and Error Handling

## Description
Implement comprehensive data validation and error handling for XML imports. This task ensures that invalid or corrupted XML files are handled gracefully with helpful error messages, and that data integrity is maintained throughout the import process.

## Goal / Objectives

- Provide clear, actionable error messages for users
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Ensure data integrity during import

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Invalid XML format shows helpful error messages
- [x] Required columns validated: creationDate, sourceName, type, unit, value
- [x] Partial import failures handled with transaction rollback
- [x] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [x] Validation rules are configurable

## Subtasks
- [x] Define validation schema for Apple Health data
- [x] Implement XML structure validation
- [x] Create field-level validators for required columns
- [x] Design user-friendly error message system
- [x] Implement transaction handling for imports
- [x] Add logging for validation failures
- [x] Create unit tests for validation scenarios
