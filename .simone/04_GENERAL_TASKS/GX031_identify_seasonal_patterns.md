## Technical Details

### Pattern Analysis Methods
1. **Fourier Analysis**:
   - FFT for frequency detection
   - Identify dominant cycles
   - Amplitude and phase extraction
   - Multiple frequency support

2. **STL Decomposition**:
   - Seasonal and Trend decomposition
   - Loess smoothing
   - Robust to outliers
   - Adjustable parameters

3. **Prophet Forecasting**:
   - Additive/multiplicative seasonality
   - Holiday effects
   - Changepoint detection
   - Uncertainty intervals

4. **Weather Correlation**:
   - Temperature impact
   - Precipitation effects
   - Daylight hours correlation
   - Location-based analysis

### Visualizations
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)

- **Polar Plots**:
  - 12-month circular layout
  - Radial distance for values
  - Year-over-year comparison
  - Smooth interpolation

- **Phase Plots**:
  - X: Current value
  - Y: Rate of change
  - Trajectory visualization
  - Pattern evolution

- **Seasonality Indicators**:
  - Strength score (0-1)
  - Confidence bands
  - Statistical significance
  - Visual gauge

- **Multi-year Overlays**:
  - Aligned by day of year
  - Transparency for layers
  - Average trend line
  - Deviation shading

### Actionable Insights
- **Pattern Prediction**:
  - Next 3-12 months forecast
  - Confidence intervals
  - Scenario planning
  - Alert thresholds

- **Goal Timing**:
  - Optimal start dates
  - Expected challenges
  - Success probability
  - Historical evidence

- **Pattern Breaks**:
  - Anomaly detection
  - Significance testing
  - Root cause analysis
  - Recovery suggestions

## Dependencies

    def __init__(self, data: pd.DataFrame):
        self.data = data
        self.fourier_analyzer = FourierAnalyzer()
        self.stl_decomposer = STLDecomposer()
        self.prophet_model = ProphetForecaster()
        self.weather_correlator = WeatherCorrelator()
        
    def analyze_seasonality(self, metric: str) -> SeasonalAnalysis:
        """Comprehensive seasonal pattern analysis"""
        metric_data = self.data[metric]
        
        return SeasonalAnalysis(
            fourier_results=self.fourier_analyzer.analyze(metric_data),
            stl_components=self.stl_decomposer.decompose(metric_data),
            forecast=self.prophet_model.forecast(metric_data),
            weather_correlation=self.weather_correlator.correlate(metric_data),
            seasonality_strength=self.calculate_strength(metric_data),
            pattern_shifts=self.detect_phase_shifts(metric_data)
        )
        
    def identify_optimal_goal_timing(self, goal_type: str) -> List[DateRange]:
        """Suggest best times to pursue goals based on patterns"""
        historical_success = self.analyze_past_achievements(goal_type)
        seasonal_factors = self.get_seasonal_factors()
        
        return self.rank_time_periods(historical_success, seasonal_factors)
        
    def create_polar_visualization(self, years: List[int]) -> PolarPlot:
        """Create circular annual pattern visualization"""
        pass
        
    def detect_pattern_breaks(self, metric: str, threshold: float = 2.0) -> List[Alert]:
        """Identify when patterns are breaking"""
        expected = self.get_expected_pattern(metric)
        actual = self.data[metric]
        deviations = (actual - expected) / expected.std()
        
        return [Alert(date, value) for date, value in deviations[deviations > threshold]]
```

### Statistical Validation
```python
def validate_seasonality(self, metric: str) -> ValidationResult:
    """Statistical validation of seasonal patterns"""
    # Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
    adf_result = adfuller(self.data[metric])
    
    # Seasonal strength test
    seasonal_strength = self.calculate_seasonal_strength(metric)
    
    # Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation
    lb_result = acorr_ljungbox(self.data[metric], lags=12)
    
    return ValidationResult(
        is_seasonal=seasonal_strength > 0.5,
        p_value=adf_result[1],
        confidence=1 - adf_result[1]
    )
```
