# Task G019: Implement Daily Metrics Calculator

## Description
Create `DailyMetricsCalculator` class in `src/analytics/` to calculate average, min, max, median, and standard deviation for each metric type. Implement percentile calculations (25th, 75th, 95th) with proper handling of edge cases.

## Goals
- [x] Create `DailyMetricsCalculator` class in `src/analytics/`
- [x] Calculate average, min, max, median, std deviation for each metric type
- [x] Implement percentile calculations (25th, 75th, 95th)
- [x] Handle edge cases gracefully
- [x] Optimize performance using numpy vectorized operations
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests with hypothesis

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Calculator correctly computes all statistical measures
- [x] Handles missing data with interpolation options
- [x] Shows "insufficient data" indicator for single data points
- [x] Implements outlier detection using IQR method
- [x] Handles time zone transitions (DST changes)
- [x] Uses numpy vectorized operations for performance
- [x] Property-based tests with hypothesis framework
- [x] Documentation includes usage examples

## Technical Details

### Edge Cases
- **Missing Data**: Provide interpolation options (linear, forward fill, none)
- **Single Data Points**: Display with "insufficient data" indicator
- **Outlier Detection**: Use IQR method (Q3 + 1.5*IQR, Q1 - 1.5*IQR)
- **Time Zone Transitions**: Handle DST changes correctly

### Performance Requirements
- Use numpy vectorized operations for all calculations
- Process 1 year of daily data in < 100ms
- Memory-efficient for large datasets

### Testing Requirements
- Property-based tests using hypothesis
- Test with various data distributions
- Edge case coverage (empty data, single point, all same values)
- Performance benchmarks

## Dependencies
- Data processing pipeline from S01
- Database models from S02
- NumPy for vectorized calculations
- Hypothesis for property-based testing

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example structure
class DailyMetricsCalculator:
    def __init__(self, data: pd.DataFrame):
        self.data = data
        
    def calculate_statistics(self, metric: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate all statistical measures for a metric"""
        pass
        
    def calculate_percentiles(self, metric: str, percentiles: List[int]) -> Dict[int, float]:
        """Calculate specified percentiles"""
        pass
        
    def detect_outliers(self, metric: str, method: str = 'iqr') -> pd.Series:
        """Detect outliers using specified method"""
        pass
```

## Notes
- Follow existing patterns from data_loader.py and database.py
- Ensure consistent timezone handling across the application
- Consider caching frequently calculated statistics
- Document all statistical methods used
