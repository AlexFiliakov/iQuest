# Task G057: Analytics Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize analytics engine performance for large datasets, implement intelligent caching, progressive loading, and ensure responsive UI during heavy computations. Focus on sub-second response times for interactive analytics.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement intelligent caching system for computed analytics
- [ ] Add progressive loading for large dataset analysis
- [ ] Create background computation with progress indicators
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for multi-year datasets
- [ ] Implement result pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Add computation priority queuing system
- [ ] Create analytics performance monitoring and profiling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analytics respond within 500ms for 1-year datasets
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 500MB for 5-year datasets
- [ ] UI remains responsive during background computations
- [ ] Cache hit ratio above 80% for repeated queries
- [ ] Progressive loading shows results within 100ms
- [ ] Background tasks can be cancelled by user
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked and logged
- [ ] Graceful degradation for extremely large datasets

## Technical Details

### Caching Strategy
- **Multi-Level Cache**: Memory → Disk → Database
- **Smart Invalidation**: Time-based and data-change triggers
- **Compression**: LZ4 compression for cached results
- **Partitioning**: Date-based cache partitions for efficient updates

### Performance Targets
- **Interactive Response**: < 100ms for cached results
- **Cold Calculations**: < 500ms for 1-year daily data
- **Memory Footprint**: < 500MB for 5-year datasets
- **Startup Time**: < 2 seconds for app launch
- **Chart Rendering**: < 200ms for complex visualizations

### Optimization Techniques
```python
class AnalyticsPerformanceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = MultiLevelCache()
        self.computation_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.memory_monitor = MemoryMonitor()
        
    def execute_analysis(self, request: AnalyticsRequest) -> AnalyticsResult:
        """Execute analytics with caching and optimization"""
        pass
        
    def cache_result(self, key: str, result: Any, ttl: int = 3600):
        """Cache computation result with TTL"""
        pass
        
    def schedule_background_computation(self, computation: Callable, 
                                      priority: int = 5):
        """Schedule heavy computation in background"""
        pass
        
    def monitor_memory_usage(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Track memory usage across analytics components"""
        pass
        
    def optimize_data_loading(self, date_range: Tuple[datetime, datetime],
                            metrics: List[str]) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Load only necessary data for computation"""
        pass
```

## Dependencies
- All analytics engines (G019-G021, G052, G053)
- Data access layer
- UI framework for progress indicators

## Implementation Notes
- Use numpy/pandas vectorized operations where possible
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Consider using Dask for very large datasets
- Profile memory usage regularly during development
- Use SQLite indexes for efficient data queries
- Implement result streaming for real-time updates

## Notes
- Monitor performance continuously with real user data
- Consider user hardware limitations (older PCs)
- Provide options to reduce computation intensity
- Implement graceful fallbacks for resource constraints
