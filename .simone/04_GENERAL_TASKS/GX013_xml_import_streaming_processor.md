# Task: XML Import with Streaming Processor

## Description
Implement XML import functionality for Apple Health data with memory-efficient streaming processor. This task focuses on building the core XML parsing infrastructure that can handle large files (up to 1GB) without excessive memory usage, following the hybrid memory/streaming approach defined in ADR-002.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create XML parser that can handle Apple Health export files
- Implement streaming approach for large files (>50MB)
- Ensure memory usage stays under 500MB for typical files
- Provide progress indication during import

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] XML parser can read Apple Health export format
- [x] Memory usage remains under 500MB for files up to 1GB
- [x] Progress callback mechanism implemented
- [x] Chunked reading implemented for files >50MB
- [x] Unit tests cover various file sizes

## Subtasks
- [x] Research Apple Health XML schema and structure
- [x] Implement SAX-based streaming XML parser
- [x] Create memory usage monitoring utilities
- [x] Implement chunk size calculation based on file size
- [x] Add progress callback interface
- [x] Create unit tests for streaming processor
- [x] Test with sample files of various sizes
