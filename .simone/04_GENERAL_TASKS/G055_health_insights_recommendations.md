# Task G055: Health Insights & Recommendations Engine

## Description
Build intelligent insights engine that analyzes health patterns, identifies opportunities for improvement, and generates personalized, actionable recommendations based on evidence-based health guidelines and individual data patterns.

## Goals
- [ ] Create pattern recognition system for health behaviors
- [ ] Build evidence-based recommendation engine
- [ ] Implement insight prioritization and relevance scoring
- [ ] Add goal-setting recommendations based on current patterns
- [ ] Create contextual insights (seasonal, lifestyle, trends)
- [ ] Build intervention suggestion system
- [ ] Generate personalized health reports and summaries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identifies meaningful patterns in user health data
- [ ] Generates actionable, evidence-based recommendations
- [ ] Prioritizes insights by potential impact and achievability
- [ ] Provides context and reasoning for each recommendation
- [ ] Adapts recommendations based on user progress and feedback
- [ ] Includes confidence scores and uncertainty indicators
- [ ] Generates weekly/monthly insight summaries
- [ ] Respects medical disclaimer and scope limitations

## Technical Details

### Insight Categories
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Sleep consistency, activity timing, recovery patterns
- **Correlation Insights**: Relationships between metrics and outcomes
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term improvements or concerning changes
- **Goal Opportunities**: Achievable targets based on current performance
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Context-aware recommendations for time of year
- **Recovery Optimization**: Rest and recovery pattern improvements

### Recommendation Framework
```python
@dataclass
class HealthInsight:
    category: str  # "sleep", "activity", "recovery", "nutrition"
    insight_type: str  # "pattern", "correlation", "trend", "opportunity"
    title: str  # Short, engaging insight title
    description: str  # Detailed explanation
    recommendation: str  # Specific, actionable advice
    evidence_level: str  # "strong", "moderate", "weak"
    confidence: float  # 0-100% confidence in insight
    priority: str  # "high", "medium", "low"
    impact_potential: str  # "high", "medium", "low"
    timeframe: str  # "immediate", "short_term", "long_term"
    supporting_data: Dict[str, Any]  # Charts, statistics, etc.
```

### Evidence-Based Guidelines
- **Sleep**: CDC, NSF sleep duration and quality guidelines
- **Activity**: WHO physical activity recommendations
- **Heart Rate**: ACSM heart rate zone guidelines
- **Recovery**: Sports science recovery principles
- **Weight Management**: NIH healthy weight guidelines

## Dependencies
- Trend analysis engine (G052)
- Correlation discovery (G053)
- Pattern analysis (existing analytics)
- Goal tracking system (G043)

## Implementation Notes
```python
class HealthInsightsEngine:
    def __init__(self, data_manager, guidelines_db):
        self.data_manager = data_manager
        self.guidelines = guidelines_db
        self.insight_generators = {}
        
    def generate_insights(self, user_data: Dict[str, pd.DataFrame],
                         time_period: str = "monthly") -> List[HealthInsight]:
        """Generate prioritized insights for user"""
        pass
        
    def analyze_sleep_patterns(self, sleep_data: pd.DataFrame) -> List[HealthInsight]:
        """Sleep-specific pattern analysis and recommendations"""
        pass
        
    def analyze_activity_patterns(self, activity_data: pd.DataFrame) -> List[HealthInsight]:
        """Activity and exercise pattern insights"""
        pass
        
    def identify_improvement_opportunities(self, metrics: Dict[str, pd.Series]) -> List[HealthInsight]:
        """Find specific, achievable improvement targets"""
        pass
        
    def generate_weekly_summary(self, insights: List[HealthInsight]) -> str:
        """Create human-readable weekly health summary"""
        pass
        
    def score_insight_relevance(self, insight: HealthInsight, 
                              user_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        """Score insight relevance for prioritization"""
        pass
```

## Notes
- Always include appropriate medical disclaimers
- Focus on behavioral changes rather than medical diagnoses
- Provide references to evidence sources when possible
- Consider user's baseline and individual context
- Avoid overwhelming users with too many recommendations at once
