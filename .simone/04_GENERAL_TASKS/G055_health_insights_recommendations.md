# Task G055: Health Insights & Recommendations Engine

## Description
Build intelligent insights engine that analyzes health patterns, identifies opportunities for improvement, and generates personalized, actionable recommendations based on evidence-based health guidelines and individual data patterns.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement enhanced rule-based insights engine with confidence scoring and context awareness
- [ ] Create pattern recognition system for health behaviors using statistical methods
- [ ] Build evidence-based recommendation engine following medical guidelines (CDC, WHO, NSF)
- [ ] Implement insight prioritization and relevance scoring with transparency
- [ ] Add goal-setting recommendations based on current patterns and achievability
- [ ] Create contextual insights (seasonal, lifestyle, trends) with WSJ-style clarity
- [ ] Build intervention suggestion system with evidence-level indicators
- [ ] Generate personalized health reports following WSJ analytics presentation principles
- [ ] Implement progressive ML enhancement for pattern recognition (future phase)
- [ ] Ensure medical safety with appropriate disclaimers and scope limitations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identifies meaningful patterns in user health data
- [ ] Generates actionable, evidence-based recommendations
- [ ] Prioritizes insights by potential impact and achievability
- [ ] Provides context and reasoning for each recommendation
- [ ] Adapts recommendations based on user progress and feedback
- [ ] Includes confidence scores and uncertainty indicators
- [ ] Generates weekly/monthly insight summaries
- [ ] Respects medical disclaimer and scope limitations

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Rule-Based Framework with Evidence Grading
**Evidence Levels (Following Medical Standards)**
- **Strong Evidence**: WHO/CDC guidelines, peer-reviewed meta-analyses
- **Moderate Evidence**: Clinical studies, professional organization recommendations
- **Weak Evidence**: Observational studies, expert opinion
- **Pattern-Based**: User-specific patterns without general medical backing

### WSJ-Style Insight Presentation
- **Clear Headlines**: Lead with the key finding or recommendation
- **Evidence Transparency**: Clear indication of recommendation strength
- **Actionable Language**: Specific, achievable steps rather than vague advice
- **Context Awareness**: Seasonal, lifestyle, and individual factors
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary → rationale → supporting data → references

### Insight Categories with Evidence Integration
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Sleep consistency, activity timing, recovery patterns (evidence-graded)
- **Correlation Insights**: Relationships between metrics with statistical confidence
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term improvements or concerning changes with significance testing
- **Goal Opportunities**: Achievable targets based on current performance and evidence
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Context-aware recommendations with seasonal research backing
- **Recovery Optimization**: Evidence-based rest and recovery improvements

    timeline: str  # Suggested timeframe for achievement
    milestones: List[Dict[str, Any]]  # Intermediate goals
    evidence_basis: InsightEvidence  # Supporting evidence
```

### Evidence-Based Guidelines
- **Sleep**: CDC, NSF sleep duration and quality guidelines
- **Activity**: WHO physical activity recommendations
- **Heart Rate**: ACSM heart rate zone guidelines
- **Recovery**: Sports science recovery principles
- **Weight Management**: NIH healthy weight guidelines

## Dependencies

### Evidence-Based Guidelines Integration

#### Sleep Guidelines (NSF, CDC)
- **Duration**: Age-appropriate sleep duration recommendations
- **Consistency**: ±30 minutes bedtime/wake time variability
- **Quality**: Sleep efficiency >85%, minimal interruptions
- **Timing**: Circadian rhythm alignment recommendations

#### Activity Guidelines (WHO, ACSM)
- **Aerobic**: 150 minutes moderate or 75 minutes vigorous weekly
- **Strength**: 2+ days per week major muscle groups
- **Steps**: 8,000-10,000+ daily steps for general health
- **Intensity**: Heart rate zone training recommendations

#### Recovery Guidelines (Sports Science)
- **Heart Rate Variability**: Trends indicating recovery status
- **Resting Heart Rate**: Baseline establishment and deviation alerts
- **Sleep Recovery**: Deep sleep percentage and recovery metrics

### WSJ Presentation Standards
- **Headlines**: Clear, specific, avoid medical jargon
- **Evidence Indicators**: Visual cues for recommendation strength
- **Confidence Display**: Transparent uncertainty communication
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary → details → evidence → references
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigation

## Notes
- Always include appropriate medical disclaimers
- Focus on behavioral changes rather than medical diagnoses
- Provide references to evidence sources when possible
- Consider user's baseline and individual context
- Avoid overwhelming users with too many recommendations at once
