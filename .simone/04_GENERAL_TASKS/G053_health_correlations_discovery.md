# Task G053: Health Correlations Discovery Engine

## Description
Build intelligent correlation discovery system that identifies meaningful relationships between health metrics, provides statistical validation, and generates actionable insights about health patterns and behaviors.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement comprehensive correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
- [ ] Create lag correlation analysis for delayed effects
- [ ] Build conditional correlation analysis (time-based, contextual)
- [ ] Add statistical significance testing and multiple comparison correction
- [ ] Implement correlation clustering and network analysis
- [ ] Create automated insight generation from correlation patterns
- [ ] Build interactive correlation visualization matrix

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calculates correlations between all metric pairs with significance testing
- [ ] Identifies time-lagged relationships (0-7 day delays)
- [ ] Provides context-aware correlations (weekday vs weekend, seasons)
- [ ] Filters spurious correlations using statistical rigor
- [ ] Generates human-readable correlation insights
- [ ] Interactive matrix visualization with drill-down capability
- [ ] Handles missing data and different sampling frequencies
- [ ] Performance: < 300ms for correlation matrix with 20+ metrics

## Technical Details

### Correlation Types
- **Instantaneous**: Same-day correlations between metrics
- **Lagged**: Delayed effects (e.g., exercise impact on next-day sleep)
- **Conditional**: Context-dependent relationships
- **Partial**: Controlling for confounding variables
- **Rolling**: Time-varying correlation strength

### Statistical Validation
- **Significance Testing**: p-values with Bonferroni correction
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's conventions for correlation strength
- **Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap confidence intervals
- **Robustness**: Outlier-resistant correlation measures

### Insight Generation
```python
@dataclass
class CorrelationInsight:
    metric_pair: Tuple[str, str]
    correlation_value: float
    significance: float
    effect_size: str  # "small", "medium", "large"
    lag_days: int  # 0 for instantaneous
    context: str  # "weekdays", "weekends", "all"
    description: str  # Human-readable insight
    strength: str  # "weak", "moderate", "strong"
    direction: str  # "positive", "negative"
```

## Dependencies
- Correlation analysis engine (G040) - enhance existing implementation
- Data filtering engine (G016)
- Statistical libraries (scipy, numpy)

## Implementation Notes
```python
class HealthCorrelationsEngine:
    def __init__(self, data_manager):
        self.data_manager = data_manager
        self.correlation_cache = {}
        
    def discover_correlations(self, metrics: List[str], 
                            max_lag_days: int = 7) -> List[CorrelationInsight]:
        """Find all significant correlations between metrics"""
        pass
        
    def calculate_lag_correlations(self, metric1: str, metric2: str,
                                 max_lag: int = 7) -> Dict[int, float]:
        """Calculate correlations at different time lags"""
        pass
        
    def conditional_correlations(self, metric1: str, metric2: str,
                               conditions: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        """Calculate correlations under specific conditions"""
        pass
        
    def generate_insights(self, correlations: pd.DataFrame) -> List[CorrelationInsight]:
        """Generate human-readable insights from correlation matrix"""
        pass
        
    def create_correlation_network(self, threshold: float = 0.3) -> nx.Graph:
        """Build network graph of significant correlations"""
        pass
```

## Notes
- Focus on clinically and behaviorally meaningful correlations
- Provide clear explanations of correlation vs causation
- Consider seasonal and cyclical patterns in correlation analysis
- Handle multicollinearity and confounding variables appropriately
