## Technical Details

### Innovative Design Features
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)

- **Radial Timeline**:
  - 24-hour clock face visualization
  - Concentric rings for different metrics
  - Interactive rotation and zoom
  - Time labels around perimeter

- **Heat Gradient**:
  - Perceptually uniform color scale
  - Intensity mapped to activity level
  - Smooth transitions between segments
  - Customizable color schemes

- **Interactive Brushing**:
  - Click and drag to select time range
  - Zoom into selected period
  - Context view maintains overview
  - Smooth animated transitions

- **ML Clustering**:
  - K-means for activity pattern detection
  - DBSCAN for anomaly identification
  - Feature extraction from time series
  - Adaptive cluster count

### Smart Features
- **Activity Detection**:
  - Algorithm to identify active vs rest
  - Configurable sensitivity thresholds
  - Learning from user patterns

- **Pattern Highlighting**:
  - Statistical anomaly detection
  - Comparison with typical patterns
  - Visual emphasis on outliers

- **Correlation Display**:
  - Cross-metric relationships
  - Time-lagged correlations
  - Interactive exploration

### Edge Cases
- **Sparse Data**: 
  - Interpolation options
  - Clear gap visualization
  - Confidence indicators

- **Day Boundaries**:
  - Smooth handling of overnight activities
  - Configurable day start time
  - Visual continuity

- **Timezones**:
  - Multiple timezone handling
  - Clear timezone indicators
  - Conversion options

## Dependencies
- G019 (Daily Metrics Calculator)
- Scikit-learn for ML clustering
- D3.js or similar for radial visualization
- PyQt6 for component integration

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example structure
class ActivityTimelineComponent(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.view_mode = 'linear'  # or 'radial'
        self.time_grouping = 60  # minutes
        self.clusterer = ActivityClusterer()
        
    def set_view_mode(self, mode: str):
        """Switch between linear and radial views"""
        pass
        
    def update_data(self, data: pd.DataFrame):
        """Update timeline with new data"""
        self.detect_patterns(data)
        self.identify_correlations(data)
        self.render_timeline()
        
    def enable_brushing(self):
        """Enable interactive time range selection"""
        pass
        
    def cluster_activities(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> List[Cluster]:
        """Use ML to cluster similar activity patterns"""
        pass
```

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for pattern detection algorithms
- Visual tests for both view modes
- Interaction tests for brushing
- ML model validation tests
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Edge case handling verification

## Notes
- Consider performance with high-frequency data
- Ensure smooth animations don't impact usability
- Provide fallback for systems without GPU acceleration
- Document ML model choices and parameters
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes

[2025-05-27 23:35]: CODE REVIEW RESULT: **FAIL**
  - **Scope:** Task G024 - Build Activity Timeline Component
  - **Findings:**
    1. Color Palette Deviation (Severity: 7/10) - Implementation uses WSJ-inspired colors (#FFF8F0, #0066CC, #CC3300) instead of specified warm earth tones (#F5E6D3, #FF8C42)
    2. Typography Deviation (Severity: 6/10) - Uses Georgia/Arial fonts instead of specified Inter/Poppins fonts
    3. Missing Performance Monitoring (Severity: 4/10) - No explicit performance tracking for <500ms chart rendering requirement
    4. Missing Animation Duration Specifications (Severity: 3/10) - No explicit animation duration settings for <300ms requirement
    5. Unchecked Dependencies (Severity: 5/10) - Uses sklearn without verifying it's in requirements.txt
  - **Summary:** The implementation successfully delivers all functional requirements but deviates from UI/UX specifications in color palette and typography. While the WSJ-inspired design is well-executed, it conflicts with the project's established warm earth tone design system.
  - **Recommendation:** Update the component to use the specified color palette (#F5E6D3, #FF8C42) and fonts (Inter/Poppins) to maintain consistency with the rest of the application. Add performance monitoring and verify sklearn dependency.
[2025-05-27 23:38]: Fixed all issues identified in code review:
  - Updated color palette to match warm earth tones from UI specifications
  - Changed typography to use Inter/Poppins fonts with proper fallbacks
  - Added scikit-learn to requirements.txt
  - Added performance monitoring for chart rendering (<500ms check)
  - Added animation duration constants (250ms/200ms) per UI specs
[2025-05-27 23:40]: CODE REVIEW RESULT (2nd Review): **PASS**
  - **Scope:** Task G024 - Build Activity Timeline Component (after fixes)
  - **Findings:** All previously identified issues have been resolved:
    1. Color palette now matches UI specifications
    2. Typography uses correct Inter/Poppins fonts
    3. Performance monitoring added for chart rendering
    4. Animation duration constants defined
    5. scikit-learn dependency added to requirements.txt
  - **Summary:** The implementation now fully complies with all specifications and requirements. The component successfully delivers all functional requirements while maintaining consistency with the project's design system.
  - **Recommendation:** Ready for completion. All acceptance criteria have been met.
