# Task: Logging and Error Handling Framework

## Description
Implement comprehensive logging and error handling infrastructure for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard. This framework will provide debugging capabilities, error tracking, and user-friendly error messages throughout the application.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust logging system that aids in development, debugging, and production monitoring.
- Set up Python logging with appropriate levels and formats
- Configure file and console logging outputs
- Implement global exception handling for PyQt6 application
- Create user-friendly error dialogs for critical errors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Logging outputs to both console and file
- [x] Log files rotate daily or by size
- [x] Different log levels work correctly (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [x] Uncaught exceptions are logged and shown to user
- [x] Log format includes timestamp, level, and module
- [x] Logging configuration is centralized

## Subtasks
- [x] Create logger.py module with logging configuration
- [x] Set up rotating file handler for log files
- [x] Configure console handler with appropriate formatter
- [x] Implement get_logger() function for module-specific loggers
- [x] Add exception hook for uncaught exceptions
- [x] Create error_dialog.py for user-facing error messages
- [x] Update main.py to initialize logging on startup
