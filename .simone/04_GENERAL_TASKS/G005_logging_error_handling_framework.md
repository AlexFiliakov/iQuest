## Description
Implement comprehensive logging and error handling infrastructure for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard. This framework will provide debugging capabilities, error tracking, and user-friendly error messages throughout the application.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust logging system that aids in development, debugging, and production monitoring.

- [ ] Different log levels work correctly (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] Uncaught exceptions are logged and shown to user
- [ ] Log format includes timestamp, level, and module
- [ ] Logging configuration is centralized

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create logger.py module with logging configuration
- [ ] Set up rotating file handler for log files
- [ ] Configure console handler with appropriate formatter
- [ ] Implement get_logger() function for module-specific loggers
- [ ] Add exception hook for uncaught exceptions
- [ ] Create error_dialog.py for user-facing error messages
