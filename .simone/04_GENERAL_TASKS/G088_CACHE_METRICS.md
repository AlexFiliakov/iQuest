## Problem Statement

The `cached_metrics` table in the main database is not being populated, causing performance issues in the Daily, Weekly, and Monthly dashboard tabs. Investigation reveals two separate caching mechanisms that are not properly integrated, resulting in cache misses and redundant calculations every time users view their data.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified

1. **Unused Database Table**: The `cached_metrics` table (0 records) in `health_monitor.db` is completely unused
2. **Dual Caching Systems**: Two incompatible caching approaches exist:
   - `CacheDAO` using `cached_metrics` table (never called)
   - `AnalyticsCacheManager` using separate `analytics_cache.db` (partially working)
3. **Key Format Mismatch**: Cache stores keys like `monthly_stats|ActiveEnergyBurned|2025|4` but queries look for `monthly_summary|StepCount|2024-01`
4. **Incomplete Import Integration**: Import process calculates summaries but doesn't cache them with correct keys
5. **Dashboard Cache Bypass**: Dashboard tabs recalculate everything due to cache misses

### Metrics That Should Be Cached

Based on dashboard requirements, the following metrics should be cached:

#### Daily Metrics
- Daily summaries (total, average, min, max) per metric
- Daily trends and comparisons
- Personal records and achievements
- Anomaly flags

#### Weekly Metrics
- Weekly aggregations (sum, average) per metric
- Week-over-week comparisons
- Weekly patterns (by day of week)
- Weekly personal records

#### Monthly Metrics
- Monthly aggregations per metric
- Month-over-month comparisons
- Monthly trends
- Seasonal patterns
- Monthly context events

#### Cross-cutting Metrics
- Health scores (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Correlation matrices
- Goal progress calculations
- Comparative analytics results

## Task Requirements

### Primary Objectives

1. **Consolidate Caching Approach**: Choose and implement one consistent caching mechanism
2. **Fix Key Format Issues**: Ensure cache keys match query patterns
3. **Integrate with Import/Delete**: Update cache on data changes
4. **Optimize Dashboard Loading**: Ensure dashboards use cached data effectively
5. **Add Cache Management**: Implement cache invalidation and monitoring

### Technical Requirements

1. Cache must persist between application sessions
2. Cache invalidation on data import or deletion
3. Thread-safe cache operations
4. Minimal memory footprint
5. Fast lookup times (< 50ms for cached queries)
6. Graceful fallback to live calculations on cache miss

- [x] Verify thread safety

### 10. Documentation and Migration
**Priority**: Low  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours

- [ ] Document cache architecture
- [ ] Add cache troubleshooting guide
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with cache details

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

1. **Use existing table** (use `cached_metrics` table) for simplicity and consistency
2. **Implement incrementally** starting with daily metrics
3. **Add monitoring early** to validate cache effectiveness
4. **Test extensively** before removing old code
5. **Profile performance** at each step

### Implementation Order

1. Fix cache key format (immediate win)
2. Update import process to populate cache
3. Update daily dashboard to use cache
4. Add cache invalidation on delete
5. Extend to weekly/monthly dashboards
6. Extend to records, achievements, and remaining features
7. Add monitoring and management
8. Optimize performance
9. Clean up old code

## Success Criteria

- [x] Dashboard load times < 500ms for cached data
- [x] Cache hit rate > 90% for repeat views
- [x] Import process populates all required caches
- [x] Delete operations properly invalidate cache
- [x] No data inconsistencies between cache and source
- [x] Memory usage remains stable
- [x] Thread-safe under concurrent access

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Inconsistency**: Implement transactional cache updates
2. **Performance Degradation**: Add circuit breakers for cache failures
3. **Migration Issues**: Provide fallback to direct queries
4. **Memory Bloat**: Implement cache size limits and eviction
5. **Concurrency Issues**: Use proper locking mechanisms

- May want to add cache warming on application startup
- Consider implementing cache versioning for future changes
- When viewing a Month, pre-cache into RAM the previous month and the next month for quick access
- When viewing a Week, pre-cache into RAM the previous week and next week for quick access
- Monitor impact on application startup time
- Plan for cache migration strategy for existing users
