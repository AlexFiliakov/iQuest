# Task G056: Export & Reporting System

## Description
Build comprehensive export and reporting system that allows users to generate professional health reports, export data in multiple formats, and create shareable insights for healthcare providers or personal tracking.

## Goals
- [ ] Create PDF health report generator with professional layout
- [ ] Implement CSV/Excel data export with customizable date ranges
- [ ] Build chart export functionality (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- [ ] Add email-ready summary reports
- [ ] Create printable dashboard views
- [ ] Implement data backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Build shareable insight cards for social/medical sharing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generates professional PDF reports with charts and insights
- [ ] Exports data in CSV, Excel formats with proper formatting
- [ ] Saves charts as high-resolution images (PNG, SVG)
- [ ] Creates email-friendly HTML summaries
- [ ] Supports custom date range selection for all exports
- [ ] Includes data integrity verification in exports
- [ ] Provides template customization for reports
- [ ] Handles large datasets efficiently during export

## Technical Details

### Export Formats
- **PDF Reports**: Multi-page health reports with charts and analysis
- **CSV/Excel**: Raw data export with proper headers and formatting
- **Image Exports**: Charts as PNG (web), SVG (vector), PDF (print)
- **HTML Summaries**: Email-friendly reports with embedded charts
- **JSON Backup**: Complete data backup with metadata

### Report Templates
- **Comprehensive Report**: Full health analysis with all metrics
- **Medical Summary**: Healthcare provider-friendly format
- **Progress Report**: Before/after comparisons and goal tracking
- **Weekly/Monthly Summary**: Regular progress updates
- **Custom Report**: User-defined metric selections and time ranges

### Data Export Features
```python
@dataclass
class ExportConfiguration:
    format: str  # "pdf", "csv", "excel", "json", "html"
    date_range: Tuple[datetime, datetime]
    metrics: List[str]  # Selected metrics to include
    include_charts: bool
    include_insights: bool
    include_raw_data: bool
    template: str  # Report template name
    resolution: str  # For image exports: "web", "print", "high"
```

## Dependencies
- Visualization suite (G054)
- Insights engine (G055)
- Chart components (G036, G037)
- Data access layer

## Implementation Notes
```python
class ExportReportingSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_manager, viz_suite, insights_engine):
        self.data_manager = data_manager
        self.viz_suite = viz_suite
        self.insights_engine = insights_engine
        self.templates = {}
        
    def generate_pdf_report(self, config: ExportConfiguration) -> bytes:
        """Generate comprehensive PDF health report"""
        pass
        
    def export_data_csv(self, metrics: List[str], 
                       date_range: Tuple[datetime, datetime]) -> bytes:
        """Export data as CSV with proper formatting"""
        pass
        
    def export_charts(self, chart_ids: List[str], 
                     format: str = "png", resolution: str = "high") -> Dict[str, bytes]:
        """Export charts as images"""
        pass
        
    def generate_html_summary(self, config: ExportConfiguration) -> str:
        """Generate email-friendly HTML summary"""
        pass
        
    def create_backup(self, include_settings: bool = True) -> bytes:
        """Create complete data backup"""
        pass
        
    def generate_shareable_insight(self, insight_id: str) -> bytes:
        """Create shareable insight card image"""
        pass
```

## Notes
- Ensure all exports maintain data privacy and security
- Include appropriate disclaimers in medical-focused reports
- Optimize export performance for large datasets
- Consider accessibility in PDF reports (screen reader compatibility)
- Provide progress indicators for long-running exports
