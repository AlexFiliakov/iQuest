# Task: SQLite Database Initialization

## Description
Set up SQLite database infrastructure for the Apple Health Monitor Dashboard, including schema creation, connection management, and basic database operations. The database will store journal entries, cached metrics, and user preferences.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust SQLite database layer that supports the application's data persistence needs.
- Design and implement database schema for journal entries and cached data
- Create database connection manager with proper error handling
- Implement database initialization on first run
- Set up database migrations framework for future updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SQLite database file is created on first application run
- [ ] Use the implemented function `convert_xml_to_sqlite` to process data and switch the UI to load from XML rather than CSV
- [ ] All required tables are created with proper schema
- [ ] Database connection manager handles connections safely
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations work for journal entries
- [ ] Database errors are properly logged and handled
- [ ] Unit tests verify database operations

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create database.py module with connection manager
- [ ] Use the implemented function `convert_xml_to_sqlite` to process data and switch the UI to load from XML rather than CSV
- [ ] Design schema for journal_entries table
- [ ] Design schema for cached_metrics table
- [ ] Implement database initialization function
- [ ] Create models.py with data classes for database entities
- [ ] Add database path configuration to config.py
- [ ] Write unit tests for database operations

## Output Log
[2025-05-27 17:44]: Task started. Moved to Sprint S02 and marked as in_progress.
