# Fix Test Collection Errors

## Description
Address the 6 test collection errors identified during test consolidation that prevent proper test discovery and execution. These errors are blocking full test suite validation and need to be resolved to ensure the consolidated test structure works correctly.

## Goal / Objectives
- Resolve all test collection errors in the test suite
- Ensure all distributed and consolidated tests can be discovered by pytest
- Validate that test imports and dependencies are correctly structured
- Enable reliable test execution across all test categories

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All 6 test collection errors are identified and fixed
- [x] `pytest --collect-only` runs without errors across all test directories
- [x] All distributed test files can be imported successfully
- [x] Consolidated widget tests are properly discovered
- [x] Test markers are correctly applied and functional
- [x] No import errors or missing dependencies in test files

## Subtasks
- [x] Run pytest collection with verbose output to identify specific error locations
- [x] Fix import paths in distributed test files
- [x] Resolve missing dependency issues in test files
- [x] Validate base test class inheritance is working correctly
- [x] Test consolidated widget file collection
- [x] Verify all test markers are properly recognized
- [x] Run full collection test across unit/, integration/, ui/ directories

## Output Log
[2025-05-28 11:25]: Started task - investigating test collection errors
[2025-05-28 11:25]: Ran pytest --collect-only - found multiple issues: missing 'chaos' and 'visual' markers, test classes with __init__ constructors
[2025-05-28 11:25]: Fixed pytest.ini by adding missing 'chaos' and 'visual' markers
[2025-05-28 11:25]: Fixed test classes with __init__ constructors in performance test files
[2025-05-28 11:25]: Renamed TestExecutionMetrics and TestSuitePerformanceBenchmark classes to avoid pytest collection
[2025-05-28 11:25]: Collection now succeeds with 927 tests collected, no errors

## Code Review Results
[2025-05-28 11:25]: **Result: PASS** - All changes align with testing infrastructure requirements and improve test collection reliability

**Scope:** G075 - Fix Test Collection Errors task implementation

**Findings:**
1. pytest.ini marker additions (Severity: 2/10) - Added 'chaos' and 'visual' markers not explicitly in SPECS_TOOLS.md but necessary for test categorization
2. Test class constructor fixes (Severity: 3/10) - Removed __init__ calls in performance test classes to enable proper pytest collection
3. Utility class renaming (Severity: 1/10) - Renamed TestExecutionMetrics and TestSuitePerformanceBenchmark to avoid pytest collection conflicts

**Summary:** Changes successfully resolve test collection errors while maintaining compatibility with existing test infrastructure. All modifications improve testing reliability without breaking existing functionality.

**Recommendation:** APPROVE - Changes are necessary infrastructure improvements that fix actual blocking issues in the test suite.

[2025-05-28 11:25]: **TASK COMPLETED** - All acceptance criteria met, test collection now works correctly with 927 tests discovered
