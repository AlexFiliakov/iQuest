# Task G024: Build Activity Timeline Component

## Description
Create an innovative hourly breakdown visualization with options for radial timeline (24-hour clock face), heat gradient showing intensity levels, interactive brushing to zoom time ranges, and activity clustering with machine learning. Support multiple time-based grouping options.

## Goals
- [ ] Create hourly breakdown visualization component
- [ ] Implement radial timeline (24-hour clock face) option
- [ ] Add heat gradient showing intensity levels
- [ ] Build interactive brushing to zoom time ranges
- [ ] Implement activity clustering with machine learning
- [ ] Support time-based grouping (15min, 30min, 1hr)
- [ ] Auto-detect active vs rest periods
- [ ] Highlight unusual patterns
- [ ] Show correlations between metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Timeline displays hourly activity breakdown
- [ ] Radial view option works smoothly
- [ ] Heat gradient clearly shows intensity variations
- [ ] Brushing interaction allows time range selection
- [ ] ML clustering identifies activity patterns
- [ ] Configurable time groupings (15/30/60 min)
- [ ] Auto-detection of active/rest periods
- [ ] Unusual patterns are highlighted
- [ ] Metric correlations visible
- [ ] Handles sparse data appropriately
- [ ] Overnight activities cross day boundaries correctly
- [ ] Multiple timezone support in single day

## Technical Details

### Innovative Design Features
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)

- **Radial Timeline**:
  - 24-hour clock face visualization
  - Concentric rings for different metrics
  - Interactive rotation and zoom
  - Time labels around perimeter

- **Heat Gradient**:
  - Perceptually uniform color scale
  - Intensity mapped to activity level
  - Smooth transitions between segments
  - Customizable color schemes

- **Interactive Brushing**:
  - Click and drag to select time range
  - Zoom into selected period
  - Context view maintains overview
  - Smooth animated transitions

- **ML Clustering**:
  - K-means for activity pattern detection
  - DBSCAN for anomaly identification
  - Feature extraction from time series
  - Adaptive cluster count

### Smart Features
- **Activity Detection**:
  - Algorithm to identify active vs rest
  - Configurable sensitivity thresholds
  - Learning from user patterns

- **Pattern Highlighting**:
  - Statistical anomaly detection
  - Comparison with typical patterns
  - Visual emphasis on outliers

- **Correlation Display**:
  - Cross-metric relationships
  - Time-lagged correlations
  - Interactive exploration

### Edge Cases
- **Sparse Data**: 
  - Interpolation options
  - Clear gap visualization
  - Confidence indicators

- **Day Boundaries**:
  - Smooth handling of overnight activities
  - Configurable day start time
  - Visual continuity

- **Timezones**:
  - Multiple timezone handling
  - Clear timezone indicators
  - Conversion options

## Dependencies
- G019 (Daily Metrics Calculator)
- Scikit-learn for ML clustering
- D3.js or similar for radial visualization
- PyQt6 for component integration

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example structure
class ActivityTimelineComponent(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.view_mode = 'linear'  # or 'radial'
        self.time_grouping = 60  # minutes
        self.clusterer = ActivityClusterer()
        
    def set_view_mode(self, mode: str):
        """Switch between linear and radial views"""
        pass
        
    def update_data(self, data: pd.DataFrame):
        """Update timeline with new data"""
        self.detect_patterns(data)
        self.identify_correlations(data)
        self.render_timeline()
        
    def enable_brushing(self):
        """Enable interactive time range selection"""
        pass
        
    def cluster_activities(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> List[Cluster]:
        """Use ML to cluster similar activity patterns"""
        pass
```

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for pattern detection algorithms
- Visual tests for both view modes
- Interaction tests for brushing
- ML model validation tests
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Edge case handling verification

## Notes
- Consider performance with high-frequency data
- Ensure smooth animations don't impact usability
- Provide fallback for systems without GPU acceleration
- Document ML model choices and parameters
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes
