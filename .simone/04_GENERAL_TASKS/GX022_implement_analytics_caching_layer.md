# Task G022: Implement Analytics Caching Layer

## Description
Design and implement a multi-tier cache architecture with L1 in-memory LRU cache for recent queries, L2 SQLite for computed aggregates, and L3 disk cache for expensive calculations. Include monitoring and performance tracking.

## Goals
- [x] Design multi-tier cache architecture (L1, L2, L3)
- [x] Implement in-memory LRU cache for recent queries
- [x] Create SQLite cache for computed aggregates
- [x] Build disk cache for expensive calculations
- [x] Implement cache invalidation strategies
- [x] Add cache monitoring and metrics
- [x] Create background refresh mechanism
- [x] Performance benchmark with load testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Three-tier cache system operational
- [x] Write-through strategy for real-time data
- [x] Time-based expiration configurable
- [x] Dependency tracking for smart invalidation
- [x] Background refresh for popular queries
- [x] Cache hit rate monitoring by query type
- [x] Memory usage tracking and limits
- [x] Performance impact analysis tools
- [x] Load testing shows >80% hit rate

## Technical Details

### Cache Architecture
```
L1: In-Memory LRU Cache
- Recent queries (last 15 minutes)
- Small result sets (<1MB)
- Fast access (<1ms)

L2: SQLite Cache
- Computed aggregates
- Medium-term storage (hours/days)
- Structured query capability

L3: Disk Cache
- Expensive calculations
- Large result sets
- Long-term storage (weeks)
```

### Cache Strategies
- **Write-Through**: Real-time data updates
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Configurable TTL
- **Dependency Tracking**: Invalidate related caches
- **Background Refresh**: Proactive cache warming

### Monitoring Features
- Cache hit/miss rates by tier
- Query type analysis
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance impact metrics
- Popular query identification

## Dependencies
- G019, G020, G021 (Calculator classes to cache)
- SQLite for L2 cache
- Redis or similar for distributed caching (future)

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example structure
class AnalyticsCacheManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.l1_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=1000)
        self.l2_cache = SQLiteCache("analytics_cache.db")
        self.l3_cache = DiskCache("./cache/")
        self.metrics = CacheMetrics()
        
    def get(self, key: str, compute_fn: Callable) -> Any:
        """Get from cache or compute"""
        # Check L1
        if result := self.l1_cache.get(key):
            self.metrics.record_hit('l1', key)
            return result
            
        # Check L2
        if result := self.l2_cache.get(key):
            self.metrics.record_hit('l2', key)
            self.l1_cache.set(key, result)
            return result
            
        # Check L3
        if result := self.l3_cache.get(key):
            self.metrics.record_hit('l3', key)
            self.promote_to_l2(key, result)
            return result
            
        # Compute and cache
        result = compute_fn()
        self.set(key, result)
        return result
        
    def invalidate_pattern(self, pattern: str):
        """Invalidate caches matching pattern"""
        pass
```

### Performance Requirements
- L1 access: <1ms
- L2 access: <10ms
- L3 access: <100ms
- Cache warm-up: <30s on startup
- Memory limit: 500MB for L1

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each cache tier
- Integration tests for tier promotion
- Invalidation logic tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory leak detection
- Concurrent access tests
- Cache corruption recovery

## Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time hit rate visualization
- Memory usage graphs
- Query pattern analysis
- Performance impact reports
- Alert thresholds configuration

## Notes
- Consider Redis for future distributed caching
- Implement cache warming on application start
- Document cache key naming conventions
- Provide cache bypass option for debugging
- Consider compression for L3 cache
- Plan for cache migration strategy
