# Optimize Analytics Calculator Tests

## Description
Apply the BaseCalculatorTest and BaseAnalyticsTest patterns to systematically consolidate the 788 analytics tests across 21 files. Focus on calculator tests, statistics tests, and trend analysis tests that have similar patterns and can benefit from parametrized testing.

## Goal / Objectives
- Reduce analytics test count from 788 to ~550-600 (25-30% reduction)
- Apply consistent BaseCalculatorTest patterns across all calculator tests
- Create parametrized tests for similar calculation scenarios
- Improve test maintainability and readability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analytics test count reduced by 25-30%
- [ ] All calculator tests inherit from BaseCalculatorTest or BaseAnalyticsTest
- [ ] Parametrized tests replace repetitive calculation tests
- [ ] Common test patterns consolidated into base classes
- [ ] Test execution time for analytics tests improved by 20%+
- [ ] Analytics test organization follows consistent structure

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze 21 analytics test files for consolidation opportunities
- [ ] Apply BaseCalculatorTest to daily/weekly/monthly calculator tests
- [ ] Create parametrized tests for statistics calculations
- [ ] Consolidate trend analysis test patterns
- [ ] Merge similar correlation and anomaly detection tests
- [ ] Apply BaseAnalyticsTest to complex analytics components
- [ ] Update test fixtures to use shared patterns
- [ ] Validate all analytics functionality remains tested
