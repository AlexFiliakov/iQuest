# Task: Implement CSV Data Loader

## Description
Create a robust CSV data loader module that can read Apple Health export data from CSV files, handle the specific data format, and load it into pandas DataFrames with appropriate data types and validation.

## Goal / Objectives
Build a reliable data loading system that can handle Apple Health CSV exports efficiently and prepare data for analysis.
- Load CSV data with proper column types
- Handle date parsing for creationDate field
- Validate data integrity and handle missing values
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CSV loader successfully reads apple_data_subset.csv
- [ ] creationDate field is parsed as datetime type
- [ ] Numeric fields are properly typed (not strings)
- [ ] Memory-efficient loading for large files
- [ ] Error handling for missing/corrupt files
- [ ] Unit tests cover main loading scenarios

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create data_loader.py module in src/
- [ ] Implement CSV reading with pandas
- [ ] Add date parsing for creationDate column
- [ ] Implement data validation and type checking
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Create unit tests for data loader
- [ ] Test with provided sample data
