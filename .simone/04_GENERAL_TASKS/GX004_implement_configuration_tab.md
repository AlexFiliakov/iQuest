# Task: Implement Configuration Tab

## Description
Create the Configuration tab interface where users can filter and subset their Apple Health data by date range and by device/metric type combinations. This tab serves as the control center for data filtering before analysis.

## Goal / Objectives
Build an intuitive configuration interface that allows users to easily filter their health data for focused analysis.
- Date range selector using creationDate field
- Multi-select for sourceName (devices)
- Multi-select for type (health metrics)
- Apply filters button with feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Date range picker with calendar widgets
- [ ] Dropdowns populated with unique sourceNames from data
- [ ] Dropdowns populated with unique types from data
- [ ] Multi-selection capability for both dropdowns
- [ ] Clear visual feedback when filters are applied
- [ ] Reset filters button functional
- [ ] Filtered data passed to other tabs

## Subtasks
- [x] Create configuration_tab.py module
- [x] Implement date range selector widgets
- [x] Create device (sourceName) multi-select dropdown
- [x] Create metric type multi-select dropdown
- [x] Implement filter application logic
- [x] Add visual feedback for active filters
- [x] Connect to data loader for dropdown population
- [x] Add reset functionality
- [x] Replace checkbox implementation with proper multi-select dropdowns for devices
- [x] Replace checkbox implementation with proper multi-select dropdowns for metrics
- [x] Implement filter presets save functionality
- [x] Implement filter presets load functionality
- [x] Add UI controls for managing filter presets

## Output Log
[2025-05-27 17:07]: Started task - implementing Configuration Tab for data filtering
[2025-05-27 17:09]: Created configuration_tab.py module with ConfigurationTab class
[2025-05-27 17:09]: Implemented all Configuration Tab components including date range selectors, multi-select dropdowns, filter logic, and visual feedback
[2025-05-27 17:10]: Updated main_window.py to use the new ConfigurationTab instead of placeholder
[2025-05-27 17:10]: Added load_csv method to DataLoader class to support CSV import functionality
[2025-05-27 17:10]: Connected configuration tab signals to main window for data and filter events
[2025-05-27 17:11]: Code Review Result: **FAIL**
  - **Scope:** Task G004 - Implement Configuration Tab
  - **Findings:** 
    1. UI Component Mismatch (Severity: 7/10) - Specifications explicitly require "multi-select dropdown" for sourceName and type filters, but implementation uses checkboxes in scroll areas instead
    2. Missing Filter Presets Feature (Severity: 6/10) - Sprint deliverable includes "Filter presets - Save/load common filter combinations" which is not implemented
  - **Summary:** The implementation provides the core filtering functionality but deviates from specifications in UI component choice and lacks the filter presets feature required by the sprint
  - **Recommendation:** Update the implementation to use multi-select dropdowns as specified and add the filter presets functionality before marking the task as complete
[2025-05-27 17:12]: Created multi_select_combo.py with CheckableComboBox widget for multi-select dropdowns
[2025-05-27 17:12]: Updated configuration_tab.py to use multi-select dropdowns instead of checkboxes
[2025-05-27 17:12]: Implemented filter presets functionality with save/load capabilities
[2025-05-27 17:12]: All code review issues have been addressed - ready for re-review
[2025-05-27 17:13]: Code Review Result: **PASS**
  - **Scope:** Task G004 - Implement Configuration Tab (Re-review after fixes)
  - **Findings:** All previously identified issues have been resolved
    1. Multi-select dropdowns now implemented using CheckableComboBox widget
    2. Filter presets functionality fully implemented with save/load capabilities
  - **Summary:** The implementation now fully complies with specifications and includes all required features
  - **Recommendation:** Task is ready for completion
