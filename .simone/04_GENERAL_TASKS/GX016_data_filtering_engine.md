# Task: Data Filtering Engine Implementation

## Description
Implement the core data filtering engine that allows users to filter imported health data by date range, sourceName, and type. This engine must be performant (<200ms response time) and support complex filter combinations.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create flexible filtering system for health data
- Support date range, sourceName, and type filters
- Ensure filter operations complete in <200ms
- Enable filter combination with AND/OR logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Date range filtering works correctly
- [x] SourceName filtering supports multiple selections
- [x] Type filtering supports multiple selections
- [x] Filters apply in <200ms for typical datasets
- [x] Filter logic can combine multiple criteria

## Subtasks
- [x] Design filter query builder architecture
- [x] Implement date range filter logic
- [x] Create sourceName filter with multi-select
- [x] Create type filter with multi-select
- [x] Optimize filter queries with indexes
- [x] Add filter performance monitoring
- [x] Create unit tests for filter combinations
