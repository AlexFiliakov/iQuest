# Task G026: Create Day-of-Week Pattern Analysis

## Description
Aggregate metrics by day of week to identify patterns like "Weekend Warrior" or "Monday Blues". Implement spider/radar charts for visualization, heatmaps with time-of-day breakdown, and statistical analysis including chi-square tests for day dependence.

## Goals
- [x] Aggregate metrics by day of week
- [x] Implement pattern recognition algorithms
- [x] Detect "Weekend Warrior" pattern
- [x] Identify "Monday Blues" pattern
- [x] Calculate consistency scoring by day
- [x] Create habit strength indicators
- [x] Build spider/radar chart visualization
- [x] Design heatmap with time-of-day breakdown
- [x] Add animated transitions between metrics
- [x] Implement chi-square test for day dependence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Metrics correctly aggregated by day of week
- [x] Pattern detection identifies common behaviors
- [x] Consistency scores calculated accurately
- [x] Spider chart displays weekly patterns clearly
- [x] Heatmap shows time-of-day variations
- [x] Smooth animations between metric views
- [x] Statistical tests validate patterns
- [x] Confidence intervals displayed for each day
- [x] Anomaly detection works per weekday
- [x] Unit tests cover pattern detection logic

## Technical Details

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Weekend Warrior**:
   - Significantly higher activity on weekends
   - Low weekday activity levels
   - Spike threshold: >150% of weekday average

2. **Monday Blues**:
   - Lower metrics on Mondays
   - Gradual improvement through week
   - Statistical significance required

3. **Consistency Scoring**:
   - Standard deviation by day
   - Coefficient of variation
   - Streak analysis

4. **Habit Strength**:
   - Regularity score (0-100)
   - Time consistency
   - Activity completion rate

### Visualizations
- **Inspired by the Wall Street Journal**: Create analytics in the style of Wall Street Journal (see for example `examples/wall street journal chart example 1.jpg` and `examples/wall street journal chart example 2.jpg`)
  
- **Spider/Radar Chart**:
  - 7 axes for days of week
  - Multiple metrics overlay
  - Interactive tooltips
  - Smooth shape morphing

- **Heatmap Design**:
  - X-axis: Days of week
  - Y-axis: Hours of day
  - Color intensity: Activity level
  - Click to drill down

- **Animated Transitions**:
  - Smooth morphing between metrics
  - Easing functions for natural motion
  - Configurable animation speed

### Statistical Analysis
- **Chi-Square Test**: Test independence of activity from day
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for each day's average
- **Anomaly Detection**: Z-score based per weekday
- **Trend Analysis**: Week-over-week patterns

## Dependencies
- G020 (Weekly Metrics Calculator)
- SciPy for statistical tests
- Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizations
- PyQt6 for integration

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Example structure
class DayOfWeekAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, data: pd.DataFrame):
        self.data = data
        self.patterns = {}
        
    def detect_weekend_warrior(self) -> PatternResult:
        """Detect weekend warrior pattern"""
        weekday_avg = self.data[self.data['day_of_week'].isin([0,1,2,3,4])].mean()
        weekend_avg = self.data[self.data['day_of_week'].isin([5,6])].mean()
        
        if weekend_avg > weekday_avg * 1.5:
            return PatternResult('weekend_warrior', confidence=0.95)
        return None
        
    def calculate_consistency_score(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate consistency score for each day"""
        scores = {}
        for day in range(7):
            day_data = self.data[self.data['day_of_week'] == day]
            scores[day] = 1 - (day_data.std() / day_data.mean())
        return scores
        
    def perform_chi_square_test(self) -> ChiSquareResult:
        """Test if activity depends on day of week"""
        pass
        
    def create_radar_chart(self, metric: str) -> Figure:
        """Create spider/radar chart for weekly pattern"""
        pass
```

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for pattern detection algorithms
- Statistical test validation
- Visual regression tests for charts
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Edge case handling (missing days)
- Animation smoothness tests

## Notes
- Consider cultural differences in week start (Sunday vs Monday)
- Provide explanations for detected patterns
- Allow users to define custom patterns
- Cache pattern detection results
- Consider seasonal variations in patterns
