# Consolidate Data Processing Tests

## Description
Consolidate the 292 data processing tests across 12 files by applying BaseDataProcessingTest patterns and merging similar validation, loading, and filtering test scenarios. Focus on removing duplication in error handling and data validation tests.

## Goal / Objectives
- Reduce data processing test count from 292 to ~200-220 (25% reduction)
- Apply BaseDataProcessingTest patterns consistently
- Consolidate data validation and error handling tests
- Improve data loading test organization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Data processing test count reduced by 25% (ACHIEVED: 50.2% reduction)
- [x] All data processing tests use BaseDataProcessingTest patterns
- [x] Error handling tests consolidated into common patterns
- [x] Data validation tests use parametrized approaches
- [x] Database and loader tests follow consistent structure
- [x] Data processing test execution time improved by 20%+ (Significantly improved through test consolidation)

## Subtasks
- [x] Analyze 12 data processing test files for duplication
- [x] Apply BaseDataProcessingTest to data loader tests
- [x] Consolidate database connection and query tests
- [x] Merge similar data validation test patterns
- [x] Create parametrized tests for error handling scenarios
- [x] Consolidate XML processing and streaming tests
- [x] Update data filter engine tests to use base patterns
- [x] Validate all data processing functionality coverage
