[2025-05-27 00:00:00] Started task - Analyzing Sprint S02 metadata
[2025-05-27 00:05:00] Enhanced task with detailed implementation approaches, edge cases, and testing strategies

## Overall Sprint S02 Architecture & Best Practices

### Data Processing Architecture
- **Pattern**: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) for clean separation
- **Data Flow**: CSV → Validator → Processor → DataFrame → Filters → View
- **Threading**: Main UI thread + Worker threads for I/O operations
- **Caching**: Use LRU cache for frequently accessed filtered data

### UI/UX Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic options first, advanced in expandable sections
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Update counts/stats as user interacts with filters
3. **Error Prevention**: Validate inputs before processing
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback options for large files or errors
5. **Consistent Styling**: Follow warm color palette from project specs

### Performance Guidelines
- Target <200ms response for all filter operations
- Use lazy loading for large datasets
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Profile memory usage regularly with memory_profiler
- Set up performance benchmarks in tests

### Testing Philosophy
- Write tests first for critical paths (TDD)
- Aim for 80% code coverage minimum
- Include integration tests for full import→filter→display flow
- Add performance regression tests
- Use pytest-qt for UI testing

### Error Handling Strategy
- Never crash - always recover gracefully
- Log errors with context for debugging
- Show user-friendly messages
- Provide actionable recovery options
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### Common PyQt6 Patterns
```python
# Non-blocking operations
class DataWorker(QThread):
    progress = pyqtSignal(int)
    finished = pyqtSignal(object)
    error = pyqtSignal(str)

# Responsive UI updates
def update_ui_safely(self):
    QApplication.processEvents()

# Memory management
def cleanup(self):
    self.large_data = None
    gc.collect()
```

## Task Breakdown for Sprint S02

### T01_S02_CSV_File_Import
**Description**: Implement CSV file import functionality with progress indication
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can select and import Apple Health CSV files through file dialog
- Progress bar shows import progress with percentage
- Supports files up to 1GB in size
- Non-blocking UI during import

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use QFileDialog with filter for CSV files (*.csv)
- Implement QThread for non-blocking file processing
- Use pandas read_csv with chunksize parameter for memory efficiency
- Emit progress signals from worker thread to update QProgressBar
- Calculate file size upfront for accurate progress percentage

**UI Best Practices**:
- Show file path after selection for user confirmation
- Display file size with human-readable format (KB/MB/GB)
- Include "Cancel" button during import with proper cleanup
- Disable other UI interactions during import to prevent conflicts
- Show estimated time remaining based on current speed

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty CSV file (show error: "File is empty")
- File locked by another process (handle PermissionError)
- Non-CSV file with .csv extension (validate first few lines)
- Import cancelled mid-process (clean up partial data)
- Unicode/encoding issues (try UTF-8, then fallback to ISO-8859-1)

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit test CSV parsing with various file sizes (1KB to 1GB)
- Test progress calculation accuracy
- Test thread cancellation and cleanup
- UI test for file dialog interaction
- Performance test: ensure <5 seconds for 100MB file

### T02_S02_Data_Validation
**Description**: Implement data validation and error handling for CSV imports
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Validates required columns: creationDate, sourceName, type, unit, value
- Shows helpful error messages for invalid CSV format
- Handles missing or malformed data gracefully
- Logs validation errors for debugging

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create DataValidator class with configurable rules
- Validate column presence before processing data
- Parse dates with multiple format fallbacks
- Convert numeric values with error handling
- Collect all errors for batch reporting

**UI Best Practices**:
- Show validation progress separately from import progress
- Display error summary with counts by type
- Provide "View Details" expandable section for errors
- Allow user to skip invalid rows or abort import
- Export validation report to text file

**Edge Cases**:
- Mixed date formats in same file
- Scientific notation in value fields
- Missing required columns (partial export)
- Extra columns (future Apple Health versions)
- Null/empty values in required fields
- Duplicate rows

**Testing Strategy**:
- Create test CSV files with known errors
- Test each validation rule independently
- Test error aggregation and reporting
- Verify logging captures all validation issues
- Performance test: validation should add <10% to import time

### T03_S02_Memory_Efficient_Processing
**Description**: Implement memory-efficient processing for large files per ADR-002
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Implements hybrid memory/streaming approach
- Uses chunked reading for files >50MB
- Memory usage stays under 500MB for typical files
- Falls back to streaming for very large files

**Implementation Approach**:
- Check file size before processing
- For files <50MB: load entirely into pandas DataFrame
- For files 50MB-500MB: use chunked processing (10MB chunks)
- For files >500MB: pure streaming with minimal buffering
- Monitor memory usage with psutil during processing
- Implement automatic garbage collection between chunks

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Use pandas dtype specification to reduce memory
- Convert strings to categories where applicable
- Process date columns as timestamps early
- Use numpy arrays for numeric operations
- Implement data sampling for preview mode

**Edge Cases**:
- System low on memory before import starts
- Memory spike during processing
- Chunk boundary splits multi-line records
- Progress calculation with streaming mode
- Switching strategies mid-import

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test with files of various sizes (1MB to 2GB)
- Monitor actual memory usage during tests
- Verify strategy selection logic
- Test memory cleanup after processing
- Stress test with multiple imports

### T04_S02_Date_Range_Filter
**Description**: Implement data filtering by date range
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can filter data by start and end dates
- Date picker UI components work correctly
- Filters apply in <200ms
- Empty date means no filter on that boundary

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use QDateEdit widgets with calendar popup
- Store dates as QDate objects internally
- Apply filters using pandas DataFrame boolean indexing
- Cache filtered results for performance
- Implement date range validation (start <= end)

**UI Best Practices**:
- Pre-populate with data's min/max dates
- Add "Last 7/30/90 days" quick presets
- Show record count preview before applying

## Task Dependencies and Sequencing

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. **T01_S02_CSV_File_Import** - Foundation for all other tasks
2. **T02_S02_Data_Validation** - Must validate before processing
3. **T03_S02_Memory_Efficient_Processing** - Core processing logic
4. **T07_S02_Data_Statistics** - Basic stats before filtering
5. **T04_S02_Date_Range_Filter** - First filter type
6. **T05_S02_Source_Type_Filter** - Second filter type
7. **T06_S02_Filter_Persistence** - After filters are working

### Critical Dependencies:
- T02 depends on T01 (need import before validation)
- T03 can be developed in parallel with T02
- T04 and T05 depend on having data loaded (T01-T03)
- T06 depends on T04 and T05 (need filters to persist)
- T07 should be updated to work with each filter as implemented

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- T01 and UI framework setup can happen simultaneously
- T04 and T05 can be developed by different developers
- T07 statistics calculations can be prototyped early
- Unit tests can be written before implementation

### Integration Points:
- All tasks must integrate with the logging framework (GX005)
- UI components should follow the design from GX003
- Data storage should use patterns from GX002
- Consider creating shared data models early

### Risk Mitigation:
- Start with T03 memory efficiency early to avoid refactoring
- Build comprehensive test data generator in T01
- Create filter interface abstraction for future filter types
- Design statistics to be extensible for future metrics
