# Milestone: M01_MVP

## Overview
First milestone delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Apple Health Analytics Dashboard.

## Objective
Create a functional Windows executable that can import Apple Health CSV data and provide basic analytical dashboards with a warm, user-friendly interface.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Import and process Apple Health CSV data
2. **Core UI Framework**: Tab-based dashboard with configuration options
3. **Basic Analytics**: Daily/Weekly/Monthly summaries with min/max/average
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Comprehensive health metrics and insights
5. **Journal Feature**: Notes capability for each time period
6. **Windows Executable**: Packaged application using PyInstaller

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Application can import and parse Apple Health CSV data
- [ ] Configuration tab allows date range and source/type filtering
- [ ] Daily, weekly, and monthly summary dashboards are functional
- [ ] Comparison features work (daily vs weekly/monthly, etc.)
- [ ] Journal feature allows saving and retrieving notes
- [ ] UI uses warm colors (tan background, orange/yellow accents)
- [ ] Charts are clear and easy to understand for non-technical users
- [ ] Application packaged as Windows executable
- [ ] Basic error handling and user feedback implemented
- [ ] README with installation and usage instructions

## Technical Requirements
- Python-based implementation
- Pandas for data processing
- PyQt5 or Tkinter for UI
- Matplotlib or Plotly for charts
- SQLite for journal storage
- PyInstaller for executable packaging

## Success Criteria
- Application runs on Windows without Python installation
- Can process typical Apple Health export files (up to 1GB)
- Response time under 5 seconds for most operations
- Intuitive UI that requires minimal training
