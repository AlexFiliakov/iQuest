- UI framework selection (Tkinter/PyQt/Kivy)
- Chart library selection (Matplotlib/Plotly)
- Packaging tool (PyInstaller/cx_Freeze)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Large CSV files causing memory issues
  - **Mitigation:** Implement streaming/chunked data processing
- **Risk:** UI framework limitations for desired aesthetics
  - **Mitigation:** Evaluate multiple frameworks early
- **Risk:** Executable size becoming too large
  - **Mitigation:** Optimize dependency inclusion

## Success Metrics
