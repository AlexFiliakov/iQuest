# Gamification Specification
## Apple Health Monitor RPG System
## Name: "iQuest"
### *"Where Your Couch Potato Evolves Into a Mighty Spud Warrior"*

### Executive Summary

Welcome to the most improbable RPG ever conceived, where your morning jog defeats dragons, your meditation unlocks cosmic powers, and your sleep schedule determines whether you're a wise sage or a chaotic gremlin. This is a world where fitness trackers are magical artifacts, protein shakes grant temporary invincibility, and the ultimate boss battle is against your own snooze button.

### Core Philosophy

- **Health as Gameplay**: Every burpee is a critical hit against the forces of lethargy
- **Humor First**: If you're not laughing, you're not leveling
- **Meaningful Choices**: Choose between "Warrior of the Weight Room" or "Wizard of the Nap Chamber"
- **No Punishment**: We celebrate victories, not shame defeats (your couch misses you anyway)
- **Accessibility**: For heroes of all fitness levels, from "Marathon Legends" to "Enthusiastic Beginners Who Once Ran for a Bus"

## 1. Character System

### 1.1 Overview
Characters represent the user's health profile as RPG stats, creating a personalized avatar that grows stronger with healthy behaviors.

### 1.2 Core Stats

| Stat | Health Metric Source | Description | Base Range |
|------|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| **HP (Hit Points)** | Overall health score | How many cookies you can eat before feeling guilty | 100-9999 |
| **Stamina** | Daily step count, active minutes | Ability to climb stairs without sounding like Darth Vader | 10-999 |
| **Strength** | Workout intensity, calories burned | Jar-opening prowess and grocery-carrying capacity | 10-999 |

| **Charisma** | Social workouts, achievements shared | Convincing friends that 5 AM workouts are "fun" | 10-999 |

### 1.3 Stat Calculations

```
