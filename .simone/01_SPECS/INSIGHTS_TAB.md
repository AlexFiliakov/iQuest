# Insights Tab Specification

## Overview
The Insights tab is the 6th tab in the Apple Health Monitor application, located between the Compare tab and Records tab.

  - Detailed description

## Data Processing

### Background Generation
- Insights are generated in a separate thread (`InsightGenerationThread`)
- Progress updates are provided during generation
- Maximum of 10 insights can be requested
- Generation uses the selected time period for analysis

### Evidence-Based Analysis
- All insights are backed by medical evidence or user pattern analysis
- Evidence sources include:
  - WHO/CDC guidelines (strong evidence)
  - Clinical studies (moderate evidence)
  - Professional organization recommendations (moderate evidence)
  - User-specific pattern analysis (pattern-based evidence)

### Insight Categories
Six main categories are supported:
1. **Sleep**: Sleep duration, quality, timing patterns
2. **Activity**: Step count, exercise patterns, movement trends
3. **Recovery**: Rest periods, recovery metrics
4. **Nutrition**: Dietary patterns (if nutritional data available)
5. **Body Metrics**: Weight trends, BMI changes, body composition
6. **Heart Health**: Heart rate patterns, blood pressure trends

## Progressive Loading Support
The widget supports progressive loading with callbacks for:
- Loading started
- Skeleton UI ready
- First data available
- Progress updates
- Loading complete
- Error handling

## Error Handling
- Import errors fall back to placeholder content
- Generation errors are logged and progress bar is hidden
- Missing data scenarios are handled gracefully
- Empty categories show "No insights available for this category"

## Integration Points
- **Main Window**: Tab is created in `_create_health_insights_tab()` method
- **Data Manager**: Insights engine receives data manager reference when data is loaded
- **Signal Connections**:
  - `refresh_requested`: Connected to main window refresh handler
  - `insight_selected`: Connected to main window insight selection handler

## Fallback Behavior
If the `HealthInsightsWidget` cannot be imported:
- A placeholder widget is created
- Shows "Health Insights & Recommendations" title (24px, #5D4E37)
- Displays explanatory text: "Personalized health insights based on your data patterns will appear here" (16px, #8B7355)
- Tab still appears with the same icon and tooltip

## Performance Considerations
- Insight generation runs in background thread to prevent UI blocking
- Progressive loading callbacks allow for responsive user experience
- Cards are created dynamically and cleaned up when refreshed
- Scroll areas are optimized for large numbers of insights
