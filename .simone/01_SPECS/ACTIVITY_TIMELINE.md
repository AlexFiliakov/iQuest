# Activity Timeline Dashboard Specification

## Executive Summary

The Activity Timeline currently performs sophisticated analytics (clustering, anomaly detection, pattern recognition) but fails to visualize these insights effectively. This specification outlines a comprehensive redesign to transform the empty visualization area into an intuitive, multi-panel dashboard that makes complex health patterns accessible to average users.

### Key Improvements
1. **Multi-Panel Layout**: Split the visualization into focused panels for different insights
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple overviews, allow drilling into details
3. **Plain Language**: Replace technical terms with user-friendly explanations
4. **Interactive Elements**: Enable exploration without overwhelming
5. **Actionable Insights**: Focus on what patterns mean for the user's health

### Summary of Recommendations

#### 1. Activity Heatmap Panel
Transform hourly activity data into an intuitive calendar heatmap showing activity intensity throughout the day and week. Users can instantly spot their most active times and identify routine patterns.

#### 2. Pattern Recognition Panel
Convert machine learning clusters into human-readable pattern cards (e.g., "Morning Routine", "Exercise Period"). Each pattern includes timing, frequency, and health implications.

#### 3. Anomaly Alert Panel
Present detected anomalies as actionable alerts with clear explanations. Instead of "DBSCAN outlier detected", show "Unusual inactivity at 2 PM - 75% below normal".

#### 4. Activity Trends Chart
Display multi-metric trends over time with goal tracking and week-over-week comparisons. Users can see if they're becoming more or less active.

#### 5. Correlation Insights Panel
Reveal relationships between activities in plain language (e.g., "More morning activity leads to better afternoon energy"). Include time-delayed correlations.

#### 6. Daily Summary Dashboard
Combine all insights into a scannable overview with health score, top insights, and quick actions. Serves as the entry point for deeper exploration.

### Implementation Approach
