# Pytest Test Suite Summary

## Test Results

### Successful Tests
- **Basic Unit Tests**: 51 tests passed successfully
  - Database tests (11 tests) - all passed
  - Data loader tests (13 tests) - all passed  
  - Cache manager tests (27 tests) - all passed
- **Integration Tests**: All integration tests passing
  - Comparative analytics integration
  - Database integration
  - Smart selection integration
  - Visualization integration
  - Week over week integration

### Test Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Import Errors in Comprehensive Tests**
   - Many comprehensive test files have import errors due to testing non-existent classes
   - Examples:
     - `test_comparative_analytics_comprehensive.py`: Tried to import `PeerGroupCriteria`, `PeerComparison`, `PeerInsight` which don't exist
     - `test_data_loader_comprehensive.py`: Tried to import `load_csv_data` which doesn't exist
     - `test_database_comprehensive.py`: Tried to import `health_database` instead of `db_manager`
     - `test_data_story_generator_comprehensive.py`: Tried to import `StoryBuilder`, `InsightExtractor`, `NarrativeEngine` which don't exist

2. **Fixes Applied**
   - Fixed imports in `test_comparative_analytics_comprehensive.py` to use existing classes
   - Fixed imports in `test_data_loader_comprehensive.py` to use correct function names
   - Fixed imports in `test_data_story_generator_comprehensive.py` to use correct classes
   - Fixed imports in `test_database_comprehensive.py` to use `db_manager`

3. **Comprehensive Tests Status**
   - The comprehensive tests appear to be written for a different version of the codebase
   - They reference many classes and functions that don't exist in the current implementation
   - These would need significant rewriting to match the current codebase

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Core Tests**: The basic unit tests and integration tests are working well and provide good coverage
2. **Comprehensive Tests**: Consider either:
   - Removing the comprehensive tests if they're outdated
   - Rewriting them to match the current codebase architecture
3. **Test Organization**: The test suite is well-organized with clear separation between unit, integration, and performance tests

## Test Command

To run the working tests:
```bash
# Run basic unit tests (excluding comprehensive tests)
pytest tests/unit -k "not comprehensive" -v

# Run integration tests  
pytest tests/integration -v

# Run all working tests (will show errors for comprehensive tests but continue)
pytest tests/ --continue-on-collection-errors -v

# Run specific working unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_database.py tests/unit/test_data_loader.py tests/unit/test_cache_manager.py -v
```

## Summary

The core test suite is functional with 51+ unit tests and all integration tests passing. The comprehensive test files appear to be from an older version of the codebase and would need significant updates to work with the current implementation. For immediate testing needs, the existing unit and integration tests provide good coverage of the application's functionality.
