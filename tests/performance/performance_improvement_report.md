## Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Impact Optimizations (Target: 25-35% improvement)

#### 1.1 Parallel Test Execution (20-30% improvement)
**Implementation**: Use pytest-xdist for parallel execution
```bash
# Current: Sequential execution
pytest tests/ --duration=0

# Optimized: Parallel execution  
pytest tests/ -n auto --duration=0
```
**Expected Impact**: 
- Unit tests: 12.5s â†’ 4-6s (4-8 workers)
- Integration tests: 8.0s â†’ 3-4s (parallel safe)
- Total time reduction: ~20-30%

#### 1.2 Test Data Optimization (8-12% improvement)
**Implementation**: 
- Lazy data generation
- Session-scoped expensive fixtures
- Smaller datasets for most tests
```python
# Current: Large dataset for all tests
@pytest.fixture
def large_dataset():
    return generate_data(days=365, records_per_day=1000)

# Optimized: Size-appropriate datasets
@pytest.fixture(params=['small', 'medium'])
def dataset(request):
    sizes = {'small': (7, 100), 'medium': (30, 200)}
    days, records = sizes[request.param]
    return generate_data(days=days, records_per_day=records)
```
**Expected Impact**: 5-10s reduction in total time

#### 1.3 UI Test Optimization (5-8% improvement)
**Implementation**:
- Fix missing qtbot fixture
- Mock heavy graphics operations
- Use headless mode for CI
```python
# Add to conftest.py
@pytest.fixture
def qtbot():
    from pytestqt.qtbot import QtBot
    return QtBot()
```
**Expected Impact**: UI tests 12.0s â†’ 6-8s

### Phase 2: Medium-Impact Optimizations (Target: 8-15% improvement)

#### 2.1 Database Connection Optimization (3-5% improvement)
**Implementation**:
- Connection pooling
- Persistent test databases
- Optimized queries
```python
# Current: New connection per test
@pytest.fixture
def db_connection():
    return sqlite3.connect(':memory:')

# Optimized: Connection pool
@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def db_pool():
    return ConnectionPool(size=4)
```

#### 2.2 Import Optimization (2-3% improvement)
**Implementation**:
- Lazy imports in test files
- Precompiled modules
- Reduced dependency loading

#### 2.3 Selective Performance Profiling (2-4% improvement)
