Menu Bar Fix Summary
===================

Problem: The navbar menu was hiding all menu elements and requiring users to click "»" to display the File and Help menu options.

Root Cause: Qt was collapsing the menu items into an overflow menu, likely due to perceived space constraints or platform-specific behavior.

Fixes Applied:

1. In main_window.py (_create_menu_bar method):
   - Added setSizePolicy to ensure the menu bar expands properly
   - Set setCornerWidget(None) to prevent corner widget usage
   - Added setMinimumWidth(200) to ensure sufficient space
   - Added updateGeometry() and setVisible(True) to force display
   - Added workaround code to prevent menu collapse

2. In style_manager.py (get_menu_bar_style method):
   - Added min-width: 200px to QMenuBar style
   - Added display: inline-block to QMenuBar::item to ensure items are shown inline

These changes ensure that:
- The File and Help menus are always visible in the menu bar
- No overflow menu ("»") appears
- The menu bar has sufficient space to display all items
- The menus are displayed in a standard left-aligned manner

The application needs to be restarted for these changes to take full effect.
