# Streamlined Import Flow Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This update streamlines the import process for Apple Health data by removing unnecessary user interactions. When a user selects "File > Import..." and chooses a valid file, the import now starts automatically without requiring additional button clicks.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Configuration Tab** (`src/ui/configuration_tab.py`)
- Modified `_on_browse_clicked()` method to automatically start import after file selection
- Added call to `self._start_import_with_progress(file_path)` when a valid file is selected

### 2. **Import Progress Dialog** (`src/ui/import_progress_dialog.py`)
- Added `SettingsManager` integration for configurable behavior
- Modified `_on_import_completed()` to auto-close the dialog after showing success message
- Added setting check for `import/show_summary_dialog` (defaults to `False`)
- Removed automatic display of ImportSummaryDialog
- Dialog now auto-closes 500ms after successful import

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
1. User selects "File > Import..."
2. File dialog opens
3. User selects file and clicks "Open"
4. User must click "Import" button
5. Progress dialog shows
6. Summary dialog appears after completion
7. User must click "Close" on summary dialog

### After:
1. User selects "File > Import..."
2. File dialog opens
3. User selects file and clicks "Open"
4. Import starts automatically
5. Progress dialog shows and auto-closes on completion

## Configuration Options

Users who prefer to see the import summary can enable it via settings:
```python
settings_manager.set_setting("import/show_summary_dialog", True)
```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test_import_flow.py` to manually verify the streamlined import flow.

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. A preference in the UI settings tab to toggle summary dialog visibility
2. Toast notifications for import success/failure instead of dialogs
3. Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+O) for direct import without dialog
