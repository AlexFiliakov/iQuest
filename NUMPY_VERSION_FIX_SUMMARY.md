# NumPy Version Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
The project had a version conflict where:
- `numpy>=2.3.0` was specified in requirements.txt
- `tensorflow==2.19.0` requires `numpy<2.2.0`
- This created an incompatible dependency conflict

## Changes Made

### 1. requirements.txt
- Changed `numpy>=2.3.0` to `numpy>=1.26.0,<2.2.0`
- Changed `pandas>=2.3.0` to `pandas>=2.2.0,<2.3.0` (for compatibility)
- Changed `scipy>=1.15.3` to `scipy>=1.14.0,<1.15.0` (for numpy compatibility)

### 2. requirements-ml.txt
- Changed `tensorflow>=2.19.0` to `tensorflow==2.19.0` (pinned version)

### 3. requirements-test.txt
- Added note about numpy constraint
- Changed `opencv-python>=4.11.0.86` to `opencv-python>=4.10.0,<4.11.0` (for numpy<2.0 compatibility)

## Rationale
- TensorFlow 2.19.0 supports Python 3.12 but requires numpy<2.2.0
- numpy 1.26.0+ provides good compatibility across all packages
- opencv-python has known issues with numpy 2.0+, so we constrain it
- All other packages are compatible with these constraints

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
```

All packages should install without conflicts on Python 3.12.
