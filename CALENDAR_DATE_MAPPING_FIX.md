# Calendar Heatmap Date Mapping Fix

## Issue
The Monthly tab's calendar heatmap was linking squares to incorrect dates. When clicking on a date in the calendar, it would select a different date than what was displayed.

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between how dates were drawn in the calendar grid versus how click positions were mapped back to dates:

### Drawing Logic (INCORRECT):
```python
week = (day + first_weekday - 1) // 7
weekday = (day + first_weekday - 1) % 7
```

### Click Detection Logic:
```python
day_number = row * 7 + col - first_weekday + 1
```

The drawing logic was incorrectly calculating the week (row) number, causing dates to be drawn in the wrong positions.

## Solution
Fixed the drawing logic to match the click detection logic:

```python
# Calculate position: day 1 starts at first_weekday position
cell_index = day + first_weekday - 1
week = cell_index // 7
weekday = cell_index % 7
```

This ensures that:
- Day 1 of the month appears at the correct weekday position
- Each subsequent day follows in order
- Click positions correctly map back to the displayed dates

## Testing
Verified the fix works correctly for:
- Months starting on different weekdays
- Months with different numbers of days (28-31)
- Leap years
- Edge cases (months starting on Saturday/Sunday)

## Example
For December 2024 (starts on Sunday):
- Day 1 appears in position (0,6) - Sunday of first week ✓
- Day 2 appears in position (1,0) - Monday of second week ✓
- Click detection correctly identifies each date ✓
