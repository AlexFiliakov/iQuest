# Metric and Source Selection Verification Checklist

This checklist ensures that all UI elements across tabs properly reflect the selected metric type and source device when filters are applied.

## Current Implementation Status

Based on code analysis:
- **Database Schema**: `health_records` table has `sourceName` field for source tracking
- **Filter System**: Configuration tab has device dropdown (`source_names`) and metric dropdown (`health_types`)
- **Signal Propagation**: `filters_applied` signal emits dict with 'devices' and 'metrics' arrays

## Verification Checklist by Tab

### 1. **Configuration Tab** âœ“
- [x] Multi-select combo boxes for metrics and devices
- [x] Filter criteria includes `source_names` and `health_types`
- [x] `filters_applied` signal emits complete filter state
- [x] Statistics widget updates with filtered data

**Code Locations**:
- `src/ui/configuration_tab.py`: Lines 1551-1553 (filter collection)
- `src/ui/configuration_tab.py`: Lines 1606-1611 (FilterCriteria creation)

---

### 5. **Compare Tab**

- [ ] Source device mentioned when specific source selected
- [ ] "All Sources" clearly indicated when no filter

**Code Locations**:
- `src/ui/comparative_visualization.py`: Check filter propagation
- `src/ui/metric_comparison_view.py`: Verify comparison logic

**Verification Steps**:
1. Select "Sleep" from "Apple Watch"
2. Verify all comparisons use Watch sleep data
3. Change to different metric and verify update

---

### 6. **Insights Tab**

**Insight Filtering**:
- [ ] Insights relevant to selected metric prioritized
- [ ] Source-specific insights when source selected
- [ ] General insights marked as "All Metrics"

**Focus Indicator**:
- [ ] Visual indicator shows when specific metric selected
- [ ] Clear "Focused on: [Metric]" message
- [ ] Option to clear focus and see all insights

**Insight Generation**:

## Cross-Tab Consistency Verification

### Selection Persistence:

- [ ] Clear visual indicator of current selection on all tabs
- [ ] Consistent filtering across all data queries

### Status Bar Updates:

- [ ] Updates immediately when selection changes
- [ ] Shows "All Metrics" or "All Sources" when unfiltered

### Performance:
- [ ] Tab switches don't reload data unnecessarily
- [ ] Cached data respects current filter
- [ ] Background calculations use filtered dataset

---

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. **Add Global Selection State**
```python
# In MainWindow
self.current_metric_filter = None  # or "All Metrics"
self.current_source_filter = None  # or "All Sources"
```

### 2. **Propagate Selection to All Tabs**
```python
def _on_filters_applied(self, filters):
    self.current_metric_filter = filters.get('metrics', [])
    self.current_source_filter = filters.get('devices', [])
    
    # Update all tabs
    for tab in self.dashboard_tabs:
        if hasattr(tab, 'update_filters'):
            tab.update_filters(filters)
```

### 3. **Add Selection Indicator Widget**
```python
class SelectionIndicator(QWidget):
    """Shows current metric/source selection"""
    def update_selection(self, metrics, sources):
        # Update display
```

### 4. **Consistent Data Access Pattern**
```python
def get_filtered_data(self, metric_filter=None, source_filter=None):
    """Standard method for all components to get filtered data"""
    # Apply consistent filtering
```

## Testing Protocol

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Single Metric, Single Source**: Select "Steps" from "iPhone" only
2. **Single Metric, All Sources**: Select "Heart Rate" from all devices
3. **Multiple Metrics, Single Source**: Select multiple metrics from one device
4. **All Metrics, Single Source**: Clear metric filter, select one device
5. **Complex Filter**: Date range + specific metric + specific source

### Automated Testing:
- Unit tests for each tab's filter handling
- Integration tests for cross-tab consistency
- Performance tests with large filtered datasets

### Edge Cases:
- No data for selected combination
- Single data point scenarios
- Missing source information
- Mixed metric units
