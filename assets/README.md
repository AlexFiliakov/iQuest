# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Apple Health Monitor application.

## Required Files

- `icon.ico` - Application icon for Windows executable (required for PyInstaller build)
  - Should be a multi-resolution ICO file containing at least 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 sizes
  - Used by PyInstaller when building the Windows executable

## Placeholder

Until a proper icon is created, the build process will need to be updated to handle the missing icon gracefully.
